00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone, this is Thor Sadigov.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.700
We're going to continue our
discussion of the SARIMA processes.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.960
In particular, in this video I'm going
to show you one specific SARIMA model,

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.470
and we're going to simulate that
SARIMA model and look at its ACF,

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.270
auto correlation function.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.290
And then we're going to try to make
sense of that Autocorrelation function.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.520
In other words, we're going to try to find
ACF of this specific model theoretically.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.820
So the objectives is to examine the ACF
of a SARIMA model in simulation.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.000
And examine the ACF of
a SARIMA model in theory.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.167
So this is the SARIMA model,
(0,0,1,0,0,1)12.

11
00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:45.331
So seasonality, this panel,
the seasonality is 12.

12
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.990
We do not have any non-seasonal or
seasonal differencing.

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.760
And we do not have any non-seasonal or
seasonal autoregressive terms.

14
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.350
So only terms we are going to have
are going to be non-seasonal and

15
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.520
seasonal moving average terms.

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.720
In other words,
our model is that Xt is equal to

17
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.200
is of this polynomial applied on Zt.

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.260
If we expand this polynomial,
we obtain that Xt basically

19
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.850
depends on Zt, Zt- 1, Zt- 12,
and interestingly Zt- 13 right?

20
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.480
So first let's simulate this.

21
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.424
So I'm going to choose theta 1 as 0.7 and
capsule theta 1 0.6.

22
00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:30.529
So, basically I'm going to have 0.7 here,
0.6 here, and

23
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:32.780
their multiplication 0.42 here.

24
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.636
This is our SARIMA(0,0,1,0,0,1)12 model.

25
00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:45.850
I have simulated this and our code is
provided to you in this lesson this week.

26
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.920
So once we simulated, I have looked at
the simulation basically the time series.

27
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.670
So this is the time series for
1,000 data points.

28
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.004
Simulation is done for 1,000 data points.

29
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.150
You might not see
the seasonality right away.

30
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.330
But if you zoom into let's
say first 100 data point,

31
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.336
you can see some kind of seasonality
going on after every 12 points.

32
00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:11.472
So this is probably starting at 0, 1,

33
00:02:11.472 --> 00:02:16.462
this 12, the time 12 and
this is time 24 and

34
00:02:16.462 --> 00:02:21.300
this is time 36, and 48 and so forth.

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.216
Okay, so
there is definitely seasonality going on.

36
00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:28.092
And I looked at the ACF
of this time serious and

37
00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:34.418
I see it basically shows me the pikes
at lag one, which is what I expected.

38
00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:41.060
It did have a moving average term, order
one, so I do expect a spike at lag one.

39
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.152
And then, it already had seasonal
moving average term in order one.

40
00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:51.238
So I expect also one spike at lag 12,

41
00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:56.990
which is basically by
the sound of my seasonality.

42
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.989
And since the my Xt already
depended on Zt- 13,

43
00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.300
I also expect this spike at lag 13.

44
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.310
So what is interesting in this case
is that I also have spike at lag 11,

45
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.240
which was not appearing
from the model itself.

46
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.810
So now I want to show you why do we
actually have a spike at lag 11.

47
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.890
And why do we have
auto-correlation at lag 11.

48
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.950
So, this is our example.

49
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.214
This is SARIMA model, and we expanded it.

50
00:03:26.214 --> 00:03:30.036
It depends on Zt, Zt-1, Zt-12 and Zt-13.

51
00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:34.290
As you can see,
it does not depend on Zt-11.

52
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.410
But still it does have other
correlation of lag 11, let's show that.

53
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.480
So let's start trying to understand
the autocovariance function, gamma k.

54
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.850
So gamma 0 is basically
covariance with itself,

55
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.690
its the variance of Xt, this is my Xt.

56
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.440
Remember the Zts are all IID,

57
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.880
they are independent identical
distributed random variables.

58
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.630
In other words, if I take the variance,
I can take the variance of each term.

59
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.890
So this is the variance
of sigma z-squared.

60
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.291
This is the variance of the noise.

61
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:07.306
And this is going to have theta 1 squared,
this is theta 1ne squared,

62
00:04:07.306 --> 00:04:08.930
this is the square of the both of them.

63
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.220
If I combine them, and I can factor it
out, gamma 0, the autocovariance at lag 0.

64
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.294
In other words, the variance of my model,

65
00:04:18.294 --> 00:04:23.260
unconditional variance is
actually this expression.

66
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.570
Let's try to find gamma 1.

67
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.650
So gamma 1 is basically
autocovariance at lag 1.

68
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.328
So I have to find covariance with XtXt-1.

69
00:04:31.328 --> 00:04:33.958
We have written Xt here and Xt-1 here.

70
00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.880
So if I want to find covariance,

71
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.240
I remember that I'm going to use the fact
the Zt is all independent from each other.

72
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.262
In particular, they're all correlated.

73
00:04:44.262 --> 00:04:46.470
I just want to find common terms.

74
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.180
I see that there's Zt-1 is common.

75
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.871
I see that Zt-13's common.

76
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:57.931
So if I just take those two terms, other
cross terms will give me covariance 0,

77
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.303
because these are IID, random variables.

78
00:05:01.303 --> 00:05:06.742
Theta 1 Zt-1, these two cross terms will

79
00:05:06.742 --> 00:05:13.515
give me theta 1 sigma z squared,
and Zt- 13 terms.

80
00:05:13.515 --> 00:05:17.363
If I combine them, I have one theta 1 but
have capital Theta 1.

81
00:05:17.363 --> 00:05:20.380
So I'm going to have theta 1,
capital Theta 1 squared.

82
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.120
If I put them together and
factor out, this becomes my gamma 1.

83
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.104
So once we have gamma 1, gamma 0,

84
00:05:26.104 --> 00:05:29.490
we can actually write
autocorrelation function at lag one.

85
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.698
So we can talk about rho 1,
so what is my rho 1?

86
00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:34.864
This is gamma 1, this is gamma 0,

87
00:05:34.864 --> 00:05:39.980
if I divide them to each other I see that
these capital Theta terms will cancel out.

88
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.762
I will obtain theta 1
over 1 + theta 1 squared.

89
00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:46.820
So it's definitely not 0
if theta 1 is not 0, right?

90
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.733
So I do have autocorellation at log 1,
this is exactly what I was expecting.

91
00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:54.197
Now side note here is that
one can actually show that

92
00:05:54.197 --> 00:05:57.996
this expression is actually less than or
equal to half.

93
00:05:57.996 --> 00:06:02.844
Because if you put them together nicely,
not [INAUDIBLE] multiply by 2, multiply by

94
00:06:02.844 --> 00:06:07.484
1 over theta 1 squared this basically
will give you (theta 1- 1) squared,

95
00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:09.440
which is always non-negative.

96
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.450
So, autocorrelation function at lag 1 is
always non-zero if theta 1 is non-zero.

97
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.887
But always less than 0.5,
as a side note, right?

98
00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:21.708
So, you're going to come
back to to the ACF, and

99
00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.300
we're actually going to confirm
from the simulation this as well.

100
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.556
Let's find gamma(2).

101
00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.640
So, autocovariance at lag 2.

102
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.071
So I have gamma 2 which
covariance of Xt with Xt- 2.

103
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:34.830
This is Xt, this is Xt- 2.

104
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.080
I try to find common terms and
there is no common terms.

105
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.040
And since these are all independent,
in particular they're uncorrelated,

106
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.230
gamma 2 is actually going to be 0.

107
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.778
If gamma 2 is 0, then rho 2,

108
00:06:48.778 --> 00:06:53.197
the autocorrelation function at lag 2,
is also 0.

109
00:06:53.197 --> 00:06:59.277
So in the same way, one can show that
all autocorrelation function at lag i,

110
00:06:59.277 --> 00:07:02.792
where i from 2 to 10, all of them are a 0,

111
00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:07.120
just the same way that we
show that rho 2 was 0.

112
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.460
Now let's look at autocovariance function
at autocorrelation function at lag 11.

113
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:20.172
Okay, so gamma 11,
this a covariance of Xt with Xt-11.

114
00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:25.641
This is the Xt, this is our model and
this is Xt-11, right?

115
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:32.860
What happens is that, once you put t-11
the second term here will give you Zt-12.

116
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.650
Which would be a common term with Xt.

117
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.220
So at this point, even though most
of the terms are uncorrelated,

118
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.890
we have a term cross term
which are correlated.

119
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.800
This is Zt- 12, this is Zt- 12.

120
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.220
From the covariance of these two terms,

121
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.250
we obtain that gamma(11) is actually
theta 1, Theta 1, gamma square z.

122
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.110
Now, which means that covariance,
autocovariance at lag 11 is now 0,

123
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.200
if theta 1 and Theta 1 is not 0.

124
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.730
And if l look at the rho 11, which is
gamma 11 over gamma 0, if I divide them,

125
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.530
I obtain the following expression,
which is definitely

126
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.350
not 0 as long as theta 1 and
capital Theta 1 is not 0.

127
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.930
Again as a side note,
one can show that these first two guys

128
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.680
theta 1 over 1 + theta 1 squared, just
like before is less than or equal to half.

129
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.615
Capital Theta1 over 1 + theta1 squared,

130
00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:34.864
these two guys also are less than or
equal to half.

131
00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:40.022
So this whole expression always is
less than or equal to 1 over 4.

132
00:08:40.022 --> 00:08:46.660
It is strictly positive as long as
theta1 and capital Theta1 is not 0.

133
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.500
Okay, so let's go back to the simulation
and let's actually confirm this.

134
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.300
So we did expect of
the correlation at lag 1 and

135
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.180
we did expect that to be less than half.

136
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.220
This is less than half.

137
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.824
This is 0.5 here.

138
00:08:58.824 --> 00:09:02.676
We do not expect much later on.

139
00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:05.703
This theoretical, all of these are 0.

140
00:09:05.703 --> 00:09:10.768
And then we expect to a spike at lag 11,
which was supposed to be now 0 and

141
00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:13.810
less than 0.25, which is the case.

142
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.370
So same way we can actually find
autocorrelation at lag 12 and

143
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.365
lag 13 and then theoretically
everything else would be 0.

144
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.172
So this is going to be our guide.

145
00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:29.400
We're going to look at actual real
life data sets in the next lecture.

146
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.980
And we're going to look at the ACF.

147
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.550
So if I see a spikes ACF
in the first few lags,

148
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.710
so that will suggest some
moving average terms for me.

149
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.460
But if I see spikes at the seasonal lags,

150
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.960
like 12 for example,
if the seasonality was 12,

151
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.940
this would suggest seasonal
moving average terms to me.

152
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.930
Okay, so what have we learned?

153
00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.500
We have learned autocorrelation function
of a SARIMA model in simulation.

154
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.340
We have also learned an autocorrelation
function of a SARIMA model in theory.
