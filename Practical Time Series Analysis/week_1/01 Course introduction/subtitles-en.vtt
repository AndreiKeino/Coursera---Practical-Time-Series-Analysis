00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.840
Welcome to practical time series analysis.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.320
Time series and their mathematical models,
so called stochastic processes,

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.430
form a really vibrant
rich areas of study and

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.020
research as well as being an area
of real practical significance.

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.760
So if you're a mathematician and

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.740
you want to study elegance,
then this is a nice course for you.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.510
You can get a good introduction
into stochastic processes.

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.440
But I suspect what's more likely true for
many of the people in this course,

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.130
if you're on the job and all of a sudden
you have to look at time series data, and

10
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.670
your mathematical background didn't
include a study of time series or

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.380
stochastic processes, this course will
help give you a nice overview, a very

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.400
practical approach to where time series
come from and how people manage them.

13
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.666
Let's take a look at what we're
going to study in the course.

14
00:00:57.228 --> 00:01:01.890
We have a few categories here, but really
the list goes on, it's almost endless.

15
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
Many people, you can imagine, if you're
looking at temperature data in Melbourne,

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.010
Australia or
if you'd like to know about earthquakes,

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.700
many people need to deal
with time series data.

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.770
Perhaps you have sales figures,
you're looking at stock prices.

19
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.982
It's a very basic object,
measuring a quantity in time and so

20
00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:27.357
it's very natural that many of us
have to deal with time series.

21
00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.200
So that was the good news.

22
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.735
This may be the bad news for
some people, but maybe not.

23
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:37.640
What do you need to be
successful in this course?

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.050
We're trying to do a course
which is kind of honest and

25
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.050
looking at the real complexities
involved in time series, but

26
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.130
keeping the mathematical
preliminaries as modest as possible.

27
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.900
So if you have calculus, let's say
calculus two, not so much because

28
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.340
we'll be integrating very much, but we'll
be dealing with sequences and series.

29
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.260
This is very natural,

30
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.640
these are time series,
then calculus would be a real plus.

31
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.500
We're assuming that you've done at least
a little bit of inferential statistics.

32
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.890
You've done a hypothesis test,
you've done some descriptive statistics,

33
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.830
so you can do a box plot,
these sorts of things.

34
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.490
We spent time during the first
week looking at these basics

35
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.127
in some depth, so if it's been a long
time since you've done any statistics,

36
00:02:30.127 --> 00:02:35.460
don't let that be too off putting, come
on in and see if you can be productive.

37
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.816
But we do assume that you
have some background.

38
00:02:39.816 --> 00:02:44.739
Also if you're dealing with time series,
you could be doing this with Excel or

39
00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.766
in our course we assume that you
have access to R, which is free,

40
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:51.560
you download it off the Internet.

41
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.840
We assume that you're and
comfortable in computers, and

42
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.070
that if we ask you to go get
a data set from a website,

43
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.570
that that'll be within your wheel house,
so to speak.

44
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.770
So we're going to be doing
a little bit of programming,

45
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.600
but ours is more a scripting environment.

46
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.117
We're not going to be
writing elaborate codes,

47
00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:14.479
but we will be calling functions
in order to analyze our data.

48
00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:21.096
In the first week then, we get started
in R, we'll figure out how to download

49
00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.360
the program, how to install it on your
computer, whether you're on Windows or

50
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.590
Mac, and
how to start working with packages.

51
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.207
We'll go back and review some of the basic
stats you might have to taken in

52
00:03:32.207 --> 00:03:34.910
a stats 100 course at some point.

53
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.280
And in particular we'll look
at regression and correlation.

54
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.070
In the second week we start visualizing
our time series and also doing modelling.

55
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.730
So we like to think about
mathematical models for

56
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.650
time series because we can study
the properties of mathematical models

57
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.140
in a very nice and general way,
and then take our insight and

58
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.370
bring them to bear on the actual time
series that we have in front of us.

59
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.760
We'll deal with autocorrelation and
autocovariance.

60
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.810
This is one of the truly fundamental ideas
in stochastic processes and time series.

61
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.080
And we'll look at some famous examples,
random walks, moving averages.

62
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.870
In the third week, we start dealing
with the concept called Stationarity,

63
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.940
which essentially if we can assume it,
it'll help us to do our modelling

64
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.040
much more efficiently,
much more obviously.

65
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.810
We'll continue to look at examples.

66
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.030
We'll get into a little bit of the
Mathematics with our Backshift Operator,

67
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.190
we'll look at series,
duality, invertibility.

68
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.078
So don't let that be too off putting.

69
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.770
In Week 4,
we continue the modeling process, and

70
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.680
try to think about mathematical objects
that will give rise to time series data.

71
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.120
Much like you can think of a random
variable as modelling the toss of a coin.

72
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.753
So we'll deal with moving average
processes, autoregressive processes,

73
00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:12.101
Yule Walker, we'll study the partial
autocorrelation coefficient,

74
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:16.732
to try to figure out from a given time
series what the model might have been that

75
00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:17.605
produced it.

76
00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:21.462
Since we are trying to model,

77
00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:25.720
we're trying to write the story
that gives rise to our time series.

78
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.550
We'll deal with model quality.

79
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.130
And there are a number
of ways to measure this.

80
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.810
The Akaike information
criterion being one of them.

81
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.889
We'll look at autoregressive, moving
average, autoregressive moving average,

82
00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.500
integrated autoregressive
moving average models.

83
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.390
We'll start thinking about how to put
in trends and seasonality sort of data.

84
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.850
And so in Week 6 you can see
Seasonality takes center stage.

85
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.240
There is a set of ideas that
were developed in the 1950s,

86
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.487
but people still find really,
really useful.

87
00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:05.770
Holt and Winters are two names
of famous mathematicians

88
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.240
that you'll see associated with this,
where we can start doing forecasting.

89
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.275
Based upon past data, can we start making
some good guesses about what we're

90
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:17.680
going to see next week,
next month or next year?

91
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.439
And so we get into the single,
double and triple exponential smoothing.

92
00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:27.836
We hope you enjoy the course, and welcome.
