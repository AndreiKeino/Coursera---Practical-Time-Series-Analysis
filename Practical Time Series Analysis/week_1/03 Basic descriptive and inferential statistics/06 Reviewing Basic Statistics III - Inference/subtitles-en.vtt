00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
Welcome back to practical time series analysis.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.280
In these introductory lectures,

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.625
we're reviewing basic statistics.

4
00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:10.548
In this lecture in particular,

5
00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:13.740
we'll look at some inferential statistics.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.050
Now if your statistical background is strong,

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.585
and if you're very comfortable in the R environment,

8
00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.630
you can move through these lectures very quickly.

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.820
They're really meant for people who either haven't done

10
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.645
statistics in any meaningful way in quite some time,

11
00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:34.745
or who are just new to R. Our objectives.

12
00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.610
We do say this is basic inferential statistics.

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.310
Our objectives are to review some basics.

14
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.280
Learn how to develop graphical intuition in new data set,

15
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.155
based upon the commands available in R.

16
00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:50.930
And learn how to perform a simple hypothesis test.

17
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.205
The data set we'll be using is a famous traditional data set.

18
00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:59.320
It's the Gossett Data on sleep.

19
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.720
So, he's reporting on results that other researchers actually had already published,

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.290
and using it to develop his techniques.

21
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.618
But the basic data set looks at two soporific drugs,

22
00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:16.550
these are drugs meant to induce extra sleep in a patient.

23
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.300
And there are 10 people in play in this data set.

24
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.600
There are two drugs and we're looking at the increase over

25
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.930
control for each of these 10 individuals with each drug.

26
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.255
The formative data frame is 20 observations and we have three variables here.

27
00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:38.615
So, 20 observations, these are 10 people,

28
00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:42.930
and so we're looking at the effect of each of two drugs here.

29
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.565
So we've got extra group and ID.

30
00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:48.485
Extra is going to be the extra amount of sleep.

31
00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:51.515
Group will tell you which drug is in play,

32
00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:54.380
and ID tells you which patient.

33
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.055
Of course, always plot your data.

34
00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:02.340
The plot command is a rather powerful one,

35
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.495
and it will make decisions based upon the kind of data

36
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:09.300
you're presenting it as to what kind of plot it's going to return.

37
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.065
We're going to plot the extra sleep on group.

38
00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:18.105
So, think of that as drug and main of course is going to put a title on a graph.

39
00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:22.105
We'll look at extra sleep in Gossett Data by group.

40
00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:24.515
Now, after that we'll do a couple other things.

41
00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:28.660
I want to have the data available to me very easily in a variable.

42
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.635
So, I'm gonna say extra dot one,

43
00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:34.670
is the extra sleep for those in group one.

44
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.500
So we're testing group identically equal to one or group identically equal to two,

45
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.920
as we assign our numbers to each of these two vectors.

46
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.762
When we look at the graph,

47
00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:50.420
we've got extra sleep.

48
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.385
it looks like the second group,

49
00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:57.805
the second drug has a pretty clear advantage over the first.

50
00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:02.880
I don't see a huge difference in heterogeneity here, there is some,

51
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.770
but I think what's most pronounced in this graph is that,

52
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.035
now this bar here in a box plot of course is telling you the median not the mean,

53
00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:17.675
but the median certainly seems to be higher in the second group.

54
00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:19.555
Now that's a visual impression,

55
00:03:19.555 --> 00:03:24.835
and what we'll do now is try to follow it up with a standard statistical test.

56
00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:27.495
As we test our hypothesis,

57
00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:30.550
we'll use the command t. test,

58
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.740
we'll put in extra one and extra two as our data.

59
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.375
You can do tests,

60
00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:40.650
you'll recall from elementary stats with independent samples,

61
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.435
and there are different ways to go within

62
00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:45.680
independent samples depending upon your variability.

63
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.900
Right now instead, we're going to treat these data as

64
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.890
paired because remember there are only 10 people in the study,

65
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.965
and there are two different drugs.

66
00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:59.550
We're going to do a two sided test rather than a one sided test,

67
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.055
because coming in I had no theory,

68
00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:07.010
no intuition that one drug would be better than the other.

69
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.120
Our results look like this.

70
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.630
We'll obtain a t value of negative four or so.

71
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.055
That's a fairly hefty t value.

72
00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:21.015
Now, if that were a z value from a normal distribution,

73
00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.350
it would be quite quite large.

74
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.620
How large it is with a T distribution,

75
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.775
depends upon your sample size.

76
00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:30.810
Our degrees of freedom in a pair of T-test like this with

77
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.040
ten individuals remember is nine and minus one,

78
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.650
and the p value we obtain is less than the standard nickel.

79
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.015
Less than point zero five.

80
00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.205
It's even less than point zero one.

81
00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:48.673
And I think many people would say that these data are highly significant.

82
00:04:48.673 --> 00:04:51.120
R agrees and is going to go with

83
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:59.035
the Alternative hypothesis that the there is a difference between the two drugs.

84
00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:03.085
It's also good to report a confidence interval.

85
00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:08.020
And another approach to a test like this would be to calculate a confidence interval and

86
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.440
see if it includes zero as a plausible value. It does not.

87
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.930
So, the 95 percent confidence interval

88
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:24.140
here is between around negative two and a half to a negative point seven.

89
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.480
Now, if it's been a little while since you've done

90
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.600
a confidence interval or a hypothesis test,

91
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.605
let's go back and remember what this is all about.

92
00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:42.570
In a standard hypothesis test we have a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis,

93
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.570
traditionally labeled H sub zero, and H sub one.

94
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.025
The null hypothesis will be no difference,

95
00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:54.290
just that the mean response is going to be the same for both drugs.

96
00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:01.245
The alternative since we're doing two tail tests will be that it's not the same.

97
00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:05.080
Alpha is what people,

98
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.104
or researchers often set up before they conduct the tests,

99
00:06:08.104 --> 00:06:10.720
probability of a type one error.

100
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.075
The probability that we're going to reject a true null hypothesis is

101
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.110
fairly standard to say that alpha equal to

102
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.010
the two values point zero five or point zero one.

103
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.530
The t value that we calculated here,

104
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.280
is we're going to look at the average of

105
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.055
the differences which is the same

106
00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:33.930
if you follow the language as the difference of the averages.

107
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.130
So, we're looking at the bar here.

108
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.465
Essentially, we're just taking the average,

109
00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:41.110
the mean value with the first group,

110
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.630
and subtracting off the average on the second.

111
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.845
It's a very intuitive thing to do.

112
00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:50.280
We'll compare that to our null hypothesis value of zero.

113
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.590
Downstairs we're going to look at variability.

114
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.540
So, we're looking at the variability of the averages here not of individuals.

115
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.170
We're going to take s sub d. So,

116
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.840
this is the sample standard deviation of the differences.

117
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.910
Now, be careful, if you take

118
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.330
the differences for these 10 individuals between the two drugs,

119
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.575
take their response on the first drug and subtract off the response in the second,

120
00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:19.315
and do that for all 10,

121
00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:21.955
and then take the standard deviation of that,

122
00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:25.255
that's the standard deviation of the differences.

123
00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:28.090
That's not going to be the same number generally speaking,

124
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.105
as if you take the standard deviation of the first data set,

125
00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:34.015
and subtract off the standard deviation of the second.

126
00:07:34.015 --> 00:07:36.445
We just have to be a little bit careful here.

127
00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:41.345
But the standard test is to look at the standard error down here,

128
00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:44.165
standard deviation divided by the square of N,

129
00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:47.245
to give us a measure of variability.

130
00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:49.000
And that's how we calculate,

131
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.640
you can follow through the numbers,

132
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.875
negative for t value.

133
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.485
So as we just said,

134
00:07:56.485 --> 00:07:59.100
d bar is the average of the differences,

135
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.285
or the difference of the averages however you like,

136
00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:07.645
and Sd is the standard deviation of the differences from the sample.

137
00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:10.080
Now R also got a p-value.

138
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.470
So what's the p-value?

139
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.225
It's the likelihood of seeing data this extreme under the null hypothesis.

140
00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:20.675
And, what we'll do here is look at twice,

141
00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:23.725
it was a two tailed test, twice.

142
00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:26.395
Now the t distribution is the one in play for us,

143
00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:28.270
that's that letter t right there.

144
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.130
And p is just short for probability.

145
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.990
So, what we're trying to do is get some tail areas here.

146
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.300
So, we're going to take twice the tail area,

147
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.030
I'll look down at the left tail,

148
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.300
I'll pop my negative four in there.

149
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.360
Nine degrees of freedom and calculate a p-value.

150
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.725
If your p value is small,

151
00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:54.893
you'll reject your null hypothesis and our p value is really quite small.

152
00:08:54.893 --> 00:08:59.516
So we rejected the null hypothesis.

153
00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:02.630
In general, if you have a hypothesis test,

154
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.170
different books have different details here,

155
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.950
but it's all they all rhyme.

156
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.065
They're all basically telling the same thing.

157
00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:12.105
You're going to state clearly what your variables are

158
00:09:12.105 --> 00:09:15.425
so that everybody knows including you what you're talking about.

159
00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:19.340
State your null and a whole alternative hypotheses,

160
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:25.330
and then divide, decide upon rather a level of significance.

161
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:30.395
Once you've got that basic framework down those organizing principles,

162
00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:31.630
go ahead and look at your data,

163
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.440
compute a test statistic,

164
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.155
and you'll run across very often z's and z's chi square as an f's.

165
00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:43.055
These are kind of the big four in an elementary statistics course.

166
00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:47.100
You'll find the p value corresponding to your test statistic,

167
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.880
and then you'll form a conclusion,

168
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.655
you'll reject or not reject typically.

169
00:09:55.655 --> 00:10:00.075
Confidence intervals are,

170
00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:04.620
there is a difference between the word confidence and probability.

171
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.035
Many people get very sticky on this and say that once an event has occurred,

172
00:10:10.035 --> 00:10:12.390
you really can't talk about probability anymore.

173
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.940
Instead you must talk about confidence.

174
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.790
The basic idea is we're trying to give

175
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.215
a good indication of where we believe the actual meaning would be,

176
00:10:22.215 --> 00:10:25.080
here it's going to be a mean difference.

177
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:30.825
The common form that you'll see for many confidence intervals is estimate.

178
00:10:30.825 --> 00:10:34.065
That was our D Bar here, plus and minus,

179
00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:38.725
some sort of table value multiplied by an estimated standard error.

180
00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.640
It's not hard to really demonstrate where this comes from.

181
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.103
In our particular case,

182
00:10:43.103 --> 00:10:44.265
we'll look at d bar,

183
00:10:44.265 --> 00:10:45.975
plus and minus the T value,

184
00:10:45.975 --> 00:10:50.200
times our standard error.

185
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.825
We already saw that R will print this out for you.

186
00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:58.098
If you like to follow along and do a hand calculation yourself,

187
00:10:58.098 --> 00:10:59.900
we've got the numbers right here.

188
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.150
It's just a direct substitution.

189
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.700
Standard error is just a shorthand notation

190
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.710
for the standard deviation of a sampling distribution.

191
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.150
And since we're dealing with means not individuals,

192
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.410
standard error is the right term to use.

193
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.635
Also, statistics are things that you compute from data.

194
00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:30.624
Parameters are usually the things that you're trying to draw inferences on,

195
00:11:30.624 --> 00:11:33.015
and it's a numerical descriptor about

196
00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:39.110
either a theoretical distribution or an actual population.

197
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.795
And we can discuss type one and type two errors.

198
00:11:42.795 --> 00:11:47.030
A lot of this is done in some more detail in the reading.

199
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.590
In this lecture you've learned how to use R to develop

200
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:56.401
graphical intuition into a data set as you're trying to answer a question,

201
00:11:56.401 --> 00:12:00.040
and we've learned how to perform a statistical hypothesis,

202
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.000
we've reviewed the concept from basic statistics and shown how to do it in R.
