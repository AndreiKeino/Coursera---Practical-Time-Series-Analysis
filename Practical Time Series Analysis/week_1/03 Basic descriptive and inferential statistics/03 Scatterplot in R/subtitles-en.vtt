Hello everyone, this is Trol Satigas.

2
00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:08.244
Objective of this video lecture
is to obtain scatterplot for

3
00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:10.096
a bivariate data in R.

4
00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:15.278
In R, I'm going to generate
some data set which simulates

5
00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:20.589
some test scores in order you and
me to get the same data set.

6
00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.954
From these random generators,
in other words random generators.

7
00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:32.523
I'm going to set.seed=2016.

8
00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:36.323
In that way, you and
I both would get the same, quote unquote,

9
00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:38.999
random data from these random generators.

10
00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:44.197
And I'm going to call Test_1_scores.

11
00:00:44.197 --> 00:00:45.357
And I will say rnorm,

12
00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:49.107
let's say I'm going to generate
some data from normal distribution.

13
00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:54.491
Let's say 50 data points

14
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.945
with average of 78.

15
00:00:58.945 --> 00:01:02.140
And with the standard deviation being 10.

16
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.748
And I am going to round them so
that I would get whole integers.

17
00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:13.514
And then I will go back and generate
some simulates and test scores for

18
00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:16.239
the second test for the same students.

19
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.325
Again, I have 50 students let's say
this time the average was 70, right?

20
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:25.777
So there was some decrease in the average.

21
00:01:25.777 --> 00:01:29.499
But the standard deviation,
let's say was 14 this time.

22
00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.563
Okay, for example,
if I just look at test 1 scores,

23
00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:37.949
let's say this is my test 1 score.

24
00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:39.233
Somebody got a 101.

25
00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.304
Let's say there was some extra
credit problem and he or

26
00:01:42.304 --> 00:01:45.395
she get at some point out of
some extra credit problem.

27
00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:51.799
And if I do test 2 scores, and
I would have this data set, all right.

28
00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.404
So I am assuming that this is paired data,
or bivariate data.

29
00:01:55.404 --> 00:02:00.154
In other words,
student 1 got 66 in test 1, but he or

30
00:02:00.154 --> 00:02:04.819
she got 72 in the second exam,
and so forth, right.

31
00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.329
So what I would like to do,
is basically obtain a scatter plot.

32
00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:09.159
How do I do it?

33
00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:14.929
I just do plot, and
I do my y axis, x axis.

34
00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.859
So if I plot now, I will get
a scatter plot like the following.

35
00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.243
So here you see, we have x label by
default is the name of the data set,

36
00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:30.060
the name of the data
set without any title.

37
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.030
So this is very bad,
we would like to have some title,

38
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.820
and we would like to have some nicer
some nice x label and y label.

39
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.117
So now, to do that, I will go back and

40
00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:47.972
say that my title should be, let's say,

41
00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:51.468
my test scores for two exams.

42
00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:56.847
And I will just write 50
students in parentheses.

43
00:02:56.847 --> 00:03:05.305
And the x label, let's say I'm
going to write Test 1 scores.

44
00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:11.382
In the y label we'll write Test 2 scores.

45
00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:15.791
If I do that I will get my title here,
Test 2 scores,

46
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:20.920
Test 1 scores, and
this is basically the scatter plot in R.

47
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.630
We could play with the colors
of this point as well.

48
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.509
For example,
if I just write color = blue here,

49
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:34.748
I might get a scatter plot
with blue dot points on it.

50
00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.139
What have you learned in this lecture?

51
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.183
You have learned how to
plot bivariate data.

52
00:03:39.183 --> 00:03:43.407
Which is called scatterplotting,
you learn how to add titles and labels and

53
00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:45.060
colors to that scatterplot.
