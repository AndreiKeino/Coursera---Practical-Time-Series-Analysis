00:00:01.331 --> 00:00:05.199
Welcome back to practical
times series analysis.

2
00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:09.534
In this set of lectures, we're reviewing
some basic statistical concepts with

3
00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:11.329
the focus on linear regression.

4
00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:18.979
In the preceding lecture, we saw how we
plot time series data especially when it

5
00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:20.929
comes to us as a time series object.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.530
We thought a little bit about
ordinary lease squares and

7
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.610
how to fit a straight
line to a set of data.

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.500
We move forward in this video by
assessing the normality of a data set.

9
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.490
If you recall, some of the standard
assumptions in regression

10
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.910
which are more important when we start
discussing inferential techniques

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.980
like hypothesis test and
confidence interval.

12
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.130
Some distributional assumptions would be
that your errors are normally distributed

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.750
with constant variance, mean of zero.

14
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.328
And also that they are independent.

15
00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:02.420
When we plot a straight line as

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.580
we did with the carbon dioxide
data available to SS CO2 in R.

17
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.220
Then with a couple quick calls,
we were able to put the AD line on

18
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.720
our time series plot and
some things are immediately obvious.

19
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.180
The data themselves are exhibiting
an oscillatory trends, some seasonality.

20
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.160
But also there's a departure from
straight line over on the left and

21
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.770
over on the right.

22
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.900
There maybe some curvature to this data.

23
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.839
Perhaps the straight line
isn't the best model.

24
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.340
When we look at a set of
plots here on the residuals,

25
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.990
we'll be able to assess normality.

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.900
A simple plotting command
that we should all know

27
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.130
is we're going to set some parameters for
our plot.

28
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.070
We're going to set it up, organize on row,
with one row and three columns of figures.

29
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.970
We inseregate our model
with the command resid.

30
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.988
We credited our linear model
in the last lecture and

31
00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:16.570
now we store the result in CO2.residuals.

32
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.010
So we've created an array
of our residuals.

33
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.910
The deviations from the actual
measured data points.

34
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.430
We would call those y sub i and
the fitted data points,

35
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.810
we would call those y sub i hat.

36
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.920
As we look at the histogram,
we can see that it's roughly symmetric and

37
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.170
mount shaped.

38
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.930
But it seems to depart from
a normal distribution,

39
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.400
especially as I observe this
one as I look at the tails.

40
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.830
We would like a somewhat less
subjective way of looking at this.

41
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.840
Also, if you have an abundance of data,
you have hundreds of data points.

42
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.920
A histogram is a valid approach for
looking at structure your data.

43
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.022
If you only have 10 or 15 data points,

44
00:03:04.022 --> 00:03:10.730
a histogram not the best way to go,
we could we could probably do better.

45
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.360
In particular if we're assessing
normality, we can do what's called

46
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.090
a normal probability plot and that's
shown in the center figure right here.

47
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.720
The fastest way to think
about normal probability plot

48
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.560
is that is a plot prepared by a software,
R in our case.

49
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.290
Invoke with a command qqnorm called on our
array and I put a title on the plot here.

50
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.919
But when I plot a qq plot for
an over probability plot.

51
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.910
If our residuals are normally distributed,
we would expect to see most of our data

52
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.460
essentially looking linear, like a
straight line you could fit on this plot.

53
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.190
Here, I see some systematic
departures from the lower and

54
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.200
upper tail and so it lets me question
the normal assumption a bit.

55
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.750
Digging a little bit deeper, what a normal
probability plot is going to do is to say.

56
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.300
if I have a certain data set, a certain
number of points, where would I expect,

57
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.080
especially if I standardize,
subtract off the mean and

58
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.698
divide by the standard deviation.

59
00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:25.120
Where would I expect to
see the first residual?

60
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.120
Where would I expect to see second
residual in a dataset of a certain size

61
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.070
of through the last one?

62
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.080
I can pair that to where I
actually have my first residual,

63
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.000
the first data point that
I'm assessing normality on.

64
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.630
And were really was the second

65
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.060
is it where you expected if it was
coming from a normal distribution?

66
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.940
Or are you systematically away?

67
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.640
We would expect to see a little
scatter in [INAUDIBLE] but

68
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.750
here this seems more
systematic than random.

69
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.660
So the residuals here seem to be

70
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.900
roughly normally distributed but
not exactly normally distributed.

71
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.390
Some of our assumptions are robust
to violating that assumption.

72
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.533
And so one might not worry too much in
a large data set with a plot like this.

73
00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:20.890
When we look at the third plot,
we've plotted our residuals on time.

74
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.070
In linear regression, this is a very
common fundamental plot that people do.

75
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.490
They have a model.

76
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.790
They look at departures from the model
assumptions through the residuals.

77
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.440
And we look at them in time to
see if any patterns emerge.

78
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.690
Here, there's a very obvious pattern,

79
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.790
that our residuals are higher than we'd
expect on the left and on the right.

80
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.170
So in other words, our data points are
systematically above the straight line on

81
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.350
the left and on the right, that's
the curvature we were talking about.

82
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.380
It's hard on such a small tight plot

83
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.670
to get a sense of the oscillatory
nature of our data.

84
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.739
So what I've done on the next plot
is to zoom in on our residuals.

85
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.200
Instead of looking across a few decades,
now we're just looking across a few years.

86
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.110
At this point,

87
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.000
it would be very hard to convince anybody
that your residuals were independent.

88
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.960
There's an apparent time
structure in your residuals.

89
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.590
From a linear regression sense,
that might not be desirable but

90
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.230
we're plotting time series data.

91
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.625
For us, the structure of these residuals
is actually quite interesting.

92
00:06:37.537 --> 00:06:38.497
In this lecture,

93
00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:42.980
in addition to reviewing some basic
concepts from linear regression.

94
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.710
We learned how to assess the normality
of residuals with qq plot or

95
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.810
a normal probability plot.

96
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.880
As we move forward, we'll review some
more concepts from linear regression and

97
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.010
review some additional concepts
in statistical inference.
