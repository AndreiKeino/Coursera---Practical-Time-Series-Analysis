00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back to
Practical Time Series Analysis.

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.260
This is the last of our gentle review
videos, where we're going over some of

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.110
the concepts you would have studied in
your introductory statistics classes.

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.750
This one particular
deals with correlation.

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.520
Correlation is a really critical topic for
us.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.700
As we study time series, very often
we use perhaps the most important

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.600
graphical tool that we have,
the ACF or auto correlation function.

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720
In order to meaningfully
interact with that,

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.879
we have to have a good understanding
of what correlation is all about.

10
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.350
There are many ways to measure
linear association, or

11
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.130
rather the association
between two variables.

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.600
Linear association is very common and
perhaps the most common of all

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.260
is Pearson's product moment
correlation coefficient.

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.780
That's what we talk about in this video.

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.710
Specifically we'll review how to plot data

16
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.460
In such way as to make a quick visual
interpretation about whether we think

17
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.765
there's a linear association
between the underlying variables.

18
00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:14.220
We'll look at the formula for
co-variance and for

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.290
correlation and we'll try to understand
where the definition comes from.

20
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.061
And I'll try to convince you that
this is really the definition

21
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:24.739
you would come up with if you
took some time to think about it.

22
00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:30.820
It's nice to have an example
to guide our thinking.

23
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.910
We'll look at the trees example,

24
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.470
which should be available
to you just by opening R.

25
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.410
If you do the help command on trees,
You'll see that we're looking at

26
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.050
a relationship between girth, height,
and volume for these black cherry trees.

27
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.470
I think of this as volume speaking to the
commercial utility of a particular tree.

28
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.500
How much lumber are we
going to get out of the tree?

29
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.730
That's an interesting thing and

30
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.850
when you're out in the middle of
the woods, it's hard to predict except

31
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.330
we could measure some variables
like girth and height.

32
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.910
Those are things that you could get
through with a tape measure or perhaps

33
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.320
a Biltmore stick, as I remember from my
Earth Science class in middle school.

34
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.023
Those are very, very, easy to obtain and

35
00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:22.438
the question is, can we use them
to make predictions about volume?

36
00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:29.820
The pairs plot that I've got here off
of this data set with a couple plotting

37
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.880
commands, in particular you can see that
I'm using red dots, tells the story.

38
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.650
Girth is very strongly
associated with volume.

39
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.260
Girth is a really great predictor
of volume in these trees.

40
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.840
The height of a tree is
also a decent predictor.

41
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.200
Not surprisingly,
as the height increases so

42
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.610
does the volume that
you're going to obtain.

43
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.860
But really girth is the strong predictor.

44
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.467
Let's calculate the covariance.

45
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:05.990
This might be a little surprising.

46
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.850
The covariance between girth and
volume is just a little under 50.

47
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.970
The covariance between height and
volume is actually more.

48
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.400
That's not consistent with
the pictures that we just saw

49
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.210
unless you start thinking about
the units that are involved.

50
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.730
When we take a correlation

51
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.750
we try to look at the relationship
without worry about the units.

52
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.970
As we switch from yards to
feet to miles to kilometers,

53
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.960
we're going to change the covariance, but
the correlation should remain the same.

54
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.072
And reassuringly here, we see that
the correlation between girth and

55
00:03:50.072 --> 00:03:51.821
volume is really quite high.

56
00:03:55.445 --> 00:03:59.985
In these pictures, we try to understand
where a formula measuring strength of

57
00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:02.200
linear association might come from.

58
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.180
You'd probably agree that on
the left we have a set of

59
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.920
data points which fall very
close to a straight line.

60
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.537
Not so on the right.

61
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.420
I've created a sort of local set of
axes here based upon the averages.

62
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.820
So if you take the average y value,
you can put a horizontal line.

63
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.610
The average x value,
you can put a vertical line.

64
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.260
And you see that the data is falling
really predominately in the first and

65
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.070
third quadrant.

66
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.900
So think about what
a deviation might look like.

67
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.190
This is an ordered pair,
there's deviation from the x,

68
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.700
there's a deviation in terms of the y.

69
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.732
This data point is above average in x and
it's above average in y as well.

70
00:04:54.732 --> 00:04:57.970
So we'll look at the deviations,
we'll have positive quantities for

71
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.460
the x deviation and the y deviation.

72
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.670
If we're going to multiply those together,
positive times the positive is positive,

73
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.630
we would still get something positive.

74
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.020
We'll do that for every data point.

75
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.180
Down here,

76
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.040
where we also have quite a few data
points, the x values are below average.

77
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.160
The y values are below average.

78
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.810
Your deviations in x and
in y are both negative.

79
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.300
Negative times a negative is a positive.

80
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.070
So if we take some sort
of cumulative measure

81
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.030
by say adding up all of
the products of the deviations,

82
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.250
we're going to get something
that's contributing coherently.

83
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.957
Look at the second quadrant and
the fourth quadrant.

84
00:05:39.957 --> 00:05:43.443
Here x values are below average,
y values are above average,

85
00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:46.750
negative times a positive is a negative.

86
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.002
Look in the fourth quadrant, the x values
are above average, the y value is below.

87
00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:56.390
And again, we would have when we
take the product of the deviations,

88
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.880
we'll have something that
gives us a negative value.

89
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.580
The positives clearly out
number the negatives and

90
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.640
we would get strong contributions
towards covariance.

91
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.010
In the figure on the right,

92
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.120
each of the quadrants seems pretty well
equally stocked with the data points.

93
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.083
Positive contributions in quadrants one
and four, negative contributions in

94
00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:27.470
quadrants two, I'm sorry with one and
three will get positive contributions.

95
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.070
In two and four we'll get negative
contributions and they kind of cancel out.

96
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.510
We would expect a strong

97
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.940
covariance in the first picture and
a weak covariance in the second.

98
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.720
The formulas that we typically use
reflect the conversations we just had.

99
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:54.080
When you look at data, your covariance
will be a sum of deviations in x and

100
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.080
y and
we can even take an averaged quantity.

101
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.574
Instead of dividing by 1 over n,
the number of data points,

102
00:07:02.574 --> 00:07:06.837
we'll come up with an unbiased
estimator by dividing by 1 / (n- 1).

103
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.979
The corresponding formula,
a little bit more theoretically or

104
00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:18.128
when considering random variables, is to
look at the covariance as an average,

105
00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:21.630
and expected value of
the centered random variables.

106
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:28.880
The correlation moves
the same sort of way.

107
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.680
For the correlation for random variables,

108
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.660
we look at an expected value and
averaged quantity.

109
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.650
And here we do some centering and
some scaling to get rid of those units.

110
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.880
You'll recall on your elementary stats
course, that if you have a data point

111
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.240
minus a mean over a standard deviation,
we're talking about standard units.

112
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.670
Very often,
people use the letter z to represent that.

113
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.250
For data sets, no surprise here.

114
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.903
We'll estimate the standard deviation and
we'll do our centering and scaling.

115
00:08:00.864 --> 00:08:05.540
There are more compact formulas
that we can come up with if we

116
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.473
introduce sum of squares notation.

117
00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:10.650
We've seen this before.

118
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:16.140
There's a definitional formula,
(x- x bar)(x- x bar).

119
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.511
But there's also a corresponding
computational formula that you get

120
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:21.349
just by doing a little bit of algebra.

121
00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:31.270
This allows us to write our covariance and
our correlation much more compactly.

122
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.110
What we're doing here is
substituting in the formula for

123
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.899
the standard deviation in
terms of the sums of squares.

124
00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:48.250
And then just noting that we can see a
sums of squares up in the numerator here.

125
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.162
There's sums of squares in the bottoms.

126
00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:54.240
We cancel all of the n – 1 terms
to get rid of some clutter.

127
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.820
And at the end of the day,

128
00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.646
the correlation can be expressed rather
simply in terms of sums of squares.

129
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.050
In this video, we took some time
to recall pairwise plotting.

130
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.690
That gave us a nice visual way of trying
to assess strength of linear association.

131
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.750
We looked at the motivation behind
the calculations for covariance and

132
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.088
correlation.

133
00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:24.208
And I tried to convince you that
the formulas really do make sense.
