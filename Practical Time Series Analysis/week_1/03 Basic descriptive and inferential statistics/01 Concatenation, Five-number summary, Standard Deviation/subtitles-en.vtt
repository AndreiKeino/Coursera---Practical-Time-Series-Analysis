Hello Everyone, I am [INAUDIBLE] Sarikov.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.720
In this video lecture we will learn how
to use concatenation operator in R.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.930
We will learn how to find 5 number
summary of a data set in R.

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.110
And learn how to find sample mean and
sample standard deviation of a data set.

5
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.280
Here I have R up and running, and
this is basically our R command shell.

6
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.760
One thing we can do is basically clear
up the console, our console here.

7
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.030
If I say clear out, and
then I have whole R console cleaned.

8
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.510
Now I can start entering my commands.

9
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.560
Let me just mention now, that in R,

10
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.620
if you start with number sign it
means that we are commenting here.

11
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.370
So we are commenting and
it just ignores that command.

12
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.946
So in this lecture we're going to first
start using concatenation operator for

13
00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:09.580
entering data set in R.

14
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.590
So how do we do that?

15
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.360
Let's say I have the following data set.

16
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.020
I have a data set, which basically

17
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.900
contains 5 numbers, 35,

18
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.790
8, 10, 23, and 42.

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.320
Now how can we enter this data
set to our variable in R?

20
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890
First, you have to define
the name of the variable.

21
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.440
We try to be as descriptive as
possible when we define our variables.

22
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.580
Let's see, we see data.1.

23
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.381
So these are in data.1,
so this are data.1.

24
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.210
And we use concatenation operator,
and it starts with C.

25
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.440
And we have to enter our numbers
in here using comma in between.

26
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.820
So we can say 35, 8, 10, 23, and 42.

27
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.744
And once we do that,
then we store our data

28
00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:06.861
set into a data.1, data.1 variable.

29
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:14.130
See, if i just write data.1,
it will show me this part numbers,

30
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.520
in that data set and
the 1 is just index of the first guy here.

31
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.590
Or I can just say print(data.1) and
then I will get the same data set.

32
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.620
So this is how we use concatenation.

33
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.430
By the way, we can use our

34
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.420
fourth arrow key in our keyboard
to go to previous commands.

35
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.890
So if I go back to data.1, the
concatenation operator, if I, for example,

36
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.560
increase spaces in between these numbers,
let's see what happens.

37
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.560
If I just go back and
look at the date, print data.1.

38
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.593
Well, nothing has changed, so,
basically when you have spaces

39
00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:04.480
in between when you use concatenation,
it ignores spaces.

40
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.410
But if I just go back and, for
example, forget about this comma here.

41
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.670
So I have 35, 8, 10, 23, but
I have forgot the comma here.

42
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.050
And come back, well,
then this is all unexpected numeric.

43
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.590
There is an unexpected numeric constant.

44
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.730
And it doesn't understand 23 or
42, so we cannot do that.

45
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.150
So this is how we use
concatenation operator.

46
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.340
Now that we have our data sets, we then
go back and try to fix that with comma.

47
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.450
Okay, now that we have our data set,

48
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.420
which is data.1,
we can do something statistics on it.

49
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.330
For example, we can find 5
number summary of this data set.

50
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.740
So how do we do this,
we can just say summary and

51
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.260
so every time we put a function in r,
we have to have a parenthesis.

52
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.610
And then argument goes into that function,
argument here is a data set for

53
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.570
that function.

54
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.550
If I do that and push Enter,
it gives me 5 number summary.

55
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.260
Well, in fact it gives me 6 numbers but
it includes a mean here as well.

56
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.250
So the usual 5 number summary
is the mean of data set,

57
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.520
first quartile, median, third quartile and
the maximum of the data set.

58
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.330
But here I also have the mean
of the data set, all right.

59
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.060
But if you want to just find
a mean of this data set directly,

60
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.230
and the command and function is the mean.

61
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.110
And the argument again is the data.1,

62
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.104
because we want to find sample mean of
our data set and this is what we get.

63
00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:45.190
Let me mention now that the definition
of the sample mean is the basically

64
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:53.400
sum of these numbers in this data set
over number of points in the data set.

65
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.690
For example,
if I just do the sum of data.1,

66
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.280
then I will actually get
the sum of all these numbers.

67
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.000
And if I divide that by 5, which means I
should get sample average, sample mean,

68
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.800
which is the same number, okay.

69
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.430
And then one last thing
I would like to mention,

70
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.780
is the standard deviation,
actually sample standard deviation.

71
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.802
If you watch,
you'll find sample standard deviation,

72
00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:22.917
we use a command sd for
standard deviation.

73
00:05:22.917 --> 00:05:28.390
People data.1, and
we find our standard deviation.

74
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.480
So what have you learned in this lecture?

75
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.430
You have learned how to enter a data set
in R using the concatenation operator.

76
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.890
You learned how to find 5
number summary of a data set in

77
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.470
R using a summary function.

78
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.346
And also you have learned how to find
sample mean and sample standard deviation

79
00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:50.640
of a data set in R using this functions
called mean and standard deviation.
