00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.175
In this video,
we begin to work with packages in R.

2
00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:06.788
We can think of a package as data sets,

3
00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:11.130
together with ways to operate
on those data sets' functions.

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.540
In this particular video, we'll try
to understand what a package is, and

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.879
begin being productive and
useful with packages.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.580
We'd like to be able to
download a package and

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.580
start accessing the data
via the functions.

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.520
I'm going to take a moment and pull up R.

9
00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:40.020
And you can see that packages
are integral to using R.

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.940
It has a button right there.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.820
We're going to install a package.

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.960
I'm selecting a mirror.

13
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.020
I'm parked in the US, so
I'll grab one of our mirrors.

14
00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:02.955
And in just a moment,
a set of packages presents itself.

15
00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:08.426
[SOUND] So as you can see, there
are very many packages available to us,

16
00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:12.619
greatly extending the functionality and
reach of R.

17
00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.178
I'm looking for faraway right now.

18
00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:18.765
I'll select it, say OK, and

19
00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:24.636
now R is taking a moment to download and

20
00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:29.420
install the faraway package.

21
00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:38.395
For some very simple ways to access
data in this particular package,

22
00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.430
we'll look at a couple commands.

23
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.780
First, we'll look at the data command.

24
00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:47.070
I'll take a moment and clear the screen.

25
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.580
If you type data just by itself,
and you spell it correctly,

26
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.093
you can see that the base R installation
has a number of data sets available.

27
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.610
If we're particular, now, to our package,

28
00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:13.700
And I'd like single quotes
around the name of the package,

29
00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:23.494
And evidently, one parenthesis,

30
00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:28.808
you can see that faraway has made
a number of data sets available to us.

31
00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:33.920
The data set that we'll be dealing
with in this particular lecture is

32
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.800
coagulation, looking at blood
coagulation time, in seconds, for

33
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.709
animals fed a variety of diets.

34
00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:53.420
If I type
data:coagulation.package='far away',

35
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.540
We bring this particular
data set available to us.

36
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.600
The ls command shows you that
coagulation is right there.

37
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.930
If we look at coagulation, just by typing
the name of the data set on the screen,

38
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:22.610
you can see that it's stored as 24 cases,
where for each case, each animal,

39
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.610
in this case, we look at coagulation
time together with diet listed.

40
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.240
If we would like to get a quick
numerical summary of our data,

41
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.725
we could type summary(coagulation).

42
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.382
And that gives the popular
five number summary,

43
00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:47.741
minimum through maximum,
with each of the quartiles represented.

44
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:53.760
This is for all 24 data points,
or 24 cases, listed together.

45
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.594
You can see that there
are 24 animals here.

46
00:03:57.594 --> 00:04:01.906
And they're disaggregated by diet,
or rather, the frequencies for

47
00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:04.180
diet are available to us right here.

48
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.360
If I were to just naively
plot coagulation,

49
00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:17.550
I would obtain a plot which
I don't find very useful.

50
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.790
I do see the coagulation times
separated out with diet here, but

51
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.150
diet isn't really a numerical variable.

52
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.480
It's more of a qualitative variable.

53
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:36.205
So instead of plotting like that,
I'm going to plot coagulation on diet.

54
00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:43.550
This is probably a more intuitive plot for
us.

55
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.390
It shows you a box plot, not for
all that data aggregated together, but

56
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.680
rather, spread out by diet.

57
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.100
There are four diets in play, so
we have four of these box plots.

58
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.180
And one would, naively,

59
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.850
quickly make an assumption that diets
A and D are operating, somehow,

60
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.540
similarly, with B and C, perhaps,
increasing coagulation time.

61
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.840
But that's just a quick
intuition based on the picture.

62
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.280
We would never draw any conclusions
without doing a formal statistical

63
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.060
test first.

64
00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:31.915
In this video,
we've learned that R has environments,

65
00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:36.600
called packages, data,
together with methods.

66
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.597
And we've been able to download
at least one of the packages.

67
00:05:39.597 --> 00:05:42.006
And you'll develop some facility for

68
00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:46.530
downloading other packages through
some of the quizzes and readings.
