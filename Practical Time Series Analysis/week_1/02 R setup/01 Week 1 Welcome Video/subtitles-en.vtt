00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.183
Welcome to our first week in
Practical Time Series Analysis.

2
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.420
As we get started in our course,
we'll need a software environment.

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.420
We've chosen to use R in this course
because it's free, it's very high quality,

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.370
and many people are working around
the world to come up with good packages,

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.150
ways that you can extend the base R
system and accomplish your goals.

6
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.890
We find that R is especially
good in time series analysis.

7
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.150
So as we get started,
we'll learn how to download and install R.

8
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.778
Many of us will probably already
have it available on our systems.

9
00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:48.340
We'll get used to working with R by
doing some basic descriptive statistics.

10
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.561
And we'll learn how to pull
down these packages in R so

11
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.935
we can extend the power of our program.

12
00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.893
Once our software environment is up and
available to us,

13
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:04.510
we'll get started by doing some
basic numerical descriptions.

14
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.440
This is really just so

15
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.190
that we're all on the same page
in how to use the environment.

16
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.940
We assume you've already seen 5 number
summaries, standard deviations, etc.

17
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.230
Now, a time series is really just
a collection of data points.

18
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.480
And so we can aggregate them and
look at a histogram, or

19
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.102
we can view them in time and
look at a time plot.

20
00:01:25.102 --> 00:01:29.445
It's really, really important to get into
the habit whenever you have a time series

21
00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:32.398
of getting a quick,
graphical look at your time series.

22
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:36.485
Within the world of
inferential statistics,

23
00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:39.410
we'll review straight-line regression.

24
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.320
We'll look at regression models and
diagnostics.

25
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.015
And these are tools that will help us
as we're exploring time series later.

26
00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:52.235
T-tests are brought in, again, as a review
because we'd like to do some inference.

27
00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:54.670
And we'll begin working with correlation.

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.127
We assume you've seen correlation
in a basic stats course, but

29
00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:02.898
correlation is really one of
the cornerstones of time series analysis.

30
00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:10.210
Now, one usually thinks of a time-series
as a realization, as a dataset let's say,

31
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.070
derived from a mathematical object
called the stochastic process.

32
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.270
When we describe this mathematical
objects, we bring in terms like, for

33
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.400
instance, stationarity.

34
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.940
We need to get some traction, we need some
mathematical structure if we're going to

35
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.730
say anything interesting
about our time series.

36
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.080
And so we look at strong stationarity,
which would

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.670
certainly make our lives easy if it
were true in our particular situation.

38
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.070
But we often find that the data sets
presents it in business, economics,

39
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.750
nature, science,
don't exhibit strong stationarity.

40
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.600
But they do exhibit weak stationarity,
or at least approximately so.

41
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.660
So we'll see how we can relax
the requirements of strong stationarity

42
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.430
to that of weak in order
to get some work done.

43
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.070
We'll look at autocovariance and
autocorrelation.

44
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.680
These are functions that allow us to get
good descriptions of our time series.

45
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.290
We start looking at some individual
expressions of stochastic processes.

46
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.440
For instance, we'll look at random walks,
we'll look at moving average processes,

47
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.620
and we'll develop these
ideas as the course unfolds.

48
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.990
In order to have a place to
essentially play, we'd like to,

49
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.060
right from the first week,
get across the idea of simulation.

50
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.530
Given a mathematical model, we'll try to
use software in order to create a data set

51
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.910
that exhibits the properties
that we think are important.

52
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.660
Again, welcome to Week one, and
we hope you enjoy the course.
