Hello everyone, this is Tural Sadigov,

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.610
in this lecture we'll be talking about
Introduction to Time Series Analysis.

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.345
So objective of this lecture
is to define a time series and

4
00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.399
get familiar with this package called,
astsa.

5
00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.480
So time series is basically a data
set that's collected through time.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.010
Now, since we are doing sampling
with adjacent points in time,

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.200
we naturally introduce a correlation into
the system which means the classical,

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.020
statistical inference might
not work in this setting.

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.860
Time series are all over the places.

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.994
We will be looking at time series
from economics and financial area.

11
00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:46.798
We'll look at the physical time series,
marketing time series,

12
00:00:46.798 --> 00:00:49.302
demographic time series and etc.

13
00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:54.234
In the next lecture I will produce some
time thoughts of some specific time

14
00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:58.250
series that's taken from
the package called astsa.

15
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.520
It's a package developed by Shumway and

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.850
Stoffer, and
it contains data sets and scripts.

17
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.560
And they use that package accompany to
their book called Time Series Analysis and

18
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.780
Its Application: With R Examples.

19
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.159
And I have also included the PDF,

20
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.957
the link to the PDF of
the documentation of this package.

21
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:26.623
So what we have learned in this lecture,
we have learned that the definition of

22
00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:30.020
time series, which is basically
data collected through time.

23
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.369
In the next lectures,

24
00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.760
upcoming lectures we will define
it slightly in a different way.

25
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.230
And we have learned
the package titled astsa.
