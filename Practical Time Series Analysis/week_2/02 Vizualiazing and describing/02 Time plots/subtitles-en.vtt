1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.470
In this video lecture,
we'll talk about some time plots.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.430
So what are the objectives
of this video lecture?

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.870
We will see some examples
of time series and

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.390
we'll try to produce some
meaningful time plots.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.980
Those are the objectives of this lecture.

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.480
We will look at a few time series
data from the package astsa,

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.930
to be specific, we'll look at
the following data set that's titled jj,

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.220
flu and so forth on astsa.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.620
I'm going to talk about
each one of them in detail.

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.900
So first data said the time
shares we want to look at is

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.030
the time series about the Johnson and
Johnson Quarterly Earnings.

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.320
If the Johnson and Johnson is a US
company and we're going to look at

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.000
the quarterly earnings for
84 quarters starting from 1964,

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.490
the first quarter to 1980,
the last quarter.

15
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.280
And it's titled jj in the package ASA.

16
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.780
At this point I'll assume that
you have already installed

17
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.140
package called ASOS Toyer Machine.

18
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.190
If you have not done refer to
one of the videos where Bill

19
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.740
is talking about installing those
packages on to your own machine.

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.830
I'm just going to use
that package also now.

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.900
So I'm just going to use require Astsa so
that I can use it.

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.360
Now that I have asta in my shell,
I'm going to look at this documentation

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.380
and the documentation says
that this includes data and

24
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.140
scripts that accompany to the book by and
Stoffer.

25
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.330
We'll be looking at the quarterly
earnings of Johnson and Johnson.

26
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.560
The data set, the timesheet is called jj.

27
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.730
If I just say help(jj), documentation
says that this is Johnson and

28
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.960
Johnson quarterly earnings per share.

29
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.944
It's collected 21 years
starting from 1960 to 1980.

30
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.920
It is already a time sense object.

31
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.040
Which means I do not use
to use this TS routine or

32
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.190
TS operator to make
the data a time series.

33
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.090
So, it is already a time series.

34
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.570
It already starts upon 1960.

35
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.990
So all I have to do is basically
put some meaningful title and

36
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.640
x label and y label into my plot command.

37
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.870
So basically here what I have is that I'm
going to plot jj, since jj is already

38
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.240
a time series object,
I do not need to write this plot.ts.

39
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.410
And I'm going to use type o,

40
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.540
which means every point in the time series
will have a little circle on it and

41
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.340
the title I put is the Johnson&Johnson
quarterly earnings per share,

42
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.080
this is a string that goes into the main,
that becomes a title.

43
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.690
For the y axis label we put,
let's say earnings, and

44
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.900
x label If I once come in,
I will obtain this time plot.

45
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.730
And I have nice title, y label, x label.

46
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.710
This first step in analysis
of a time series is basically

47
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.910
to produce the point plot,

48
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.990
because by just looking at the time plot,
it gives you an idea of what's going on.

49
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.200
By just looking at this time plot,
I would say there's some kind of trend

50
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.040
Throughout the years, so definitely
there's an increase throughout the years.

51
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.930
I can see the trend, but
I can also see fluctuations,

52
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.570
the seasonal variations on that trend.

53
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.040
So there is a seasonal
effect in this time series.

54
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.750
There is some kind of a trend, but one
other thing I realize is the following.

55
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.170
At the beginning,
my time series data At the beginning

56
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.650
the variation is not that much.But
the leg room I have a higher variations.

57
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.420
Now later on we will see that if
we have a transitional affect or

58
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.685
if you have a different variation
different parts of the time series.

59
00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:59.700
It actually violates so-called stationary
principle, which I will talk about

60
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.580
next For now, we'll produce the time plot,
we have an idea what's going on.

61
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.510
Next time series is about pneumonia and
influenza.

62
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.300
That's in the US from 1968 to 1978,
so this is a 11 year period.

63
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.570
And they basically recorded
the monthly deaths per 10,000 people.

64
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.640
So this data is called flu
with ASA at the time series.

65
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.930
Let's look at the time plot.

66
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.330
Before I do that I am
going to say health flu so

67
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.320
that I can get an idea of I can get
the documentation about this flu.

68
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.950
It actually says the monthly Pneumonia and

69
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.040
influenza deaths in
the US from 1968 to 1978.

70
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.559
And it is per, that's number of deaths
per 10,000 people monthly for 11 years.

71
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.260
It is already a time
series object which means

72
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.980
I do not have to deal with
ts operator here either.

73
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.627
And it starts from 1968.

74
00:05:02.627 --> 00:05:04.491
It ends at 1979.

75
00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:07.840
Flu, The plot flu data.

76
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.140
And I put the sum title.

77
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.300
And a y label, an x label.

78
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.600
And we obtained the following time plot.

79
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.850
In this time plot, we see that there
is some kind of seasonality going on.

80
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.919
There is a peak every after year or so.

81
00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.480
And that kind of shows that
there is some kind of systality

82
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.422
going on in this data which is
definitely not a stationary time

83
00:05:33.422 --> 00:05:37.532
series which I will talk
about in the next lecture.

84
00:05:37.532 --> 00:05:42.540
But if you look at the over all trend,
there might be a trend that

85
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.277
overall number of tasks going
down which might hard to see.

86
00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:50.990
But okay, so
this is the time plot for flu data.

87
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.040
The next time stretch we're going
to look at is called globtemp.

88
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.700
It is about land-ocean temperature.

89
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:05.190
The global mean land-ocean temperature and
they're recorded how much land-ocean

90
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.720
global temperature, mean temperature,
is deviating from some base temperature.

91
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.070
And that base temperature is taking
the average from 1951 til 1980.

92
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.510
So that's our average.

93
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.180
That's our base temperature.

94
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.390
And we'll look at the deviations
from that temperature and

95
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.060
data is collected from 1880 til 2015.

96
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.770
And the source is actually NASA.

97
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.390
So I say plot globtemp and
I put a title and

98
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.685
the y label, an x label and I plot it.

99
00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:42.260
I see time plot.

100
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.640
Basically from this time plot
my first impression is that

101
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.490
there is some kind of trend.

102
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.840
So temperature deviations are going up.

103
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.870
And even though there is a trend, there's
some kind of seasonality on that trend

104
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.570
as well, probably,
because of the seasons of the year.

105
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.475
Next time series is the land
only temperature deviations, so

106
00:07:04.475 --> 00:07:05.912
this idea is the same.

107
00:07:05.912 --> 00:07:08.315
It is between 1880 to 2015.

108
00:07:08.315 --> 00:07:13.239
It is a game temperature deviations
which is measured in centigrade from

109
00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:15.300
the base temperature.

110
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.330
But this is for lab only.

111
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.270
So go ahead at this point try to obtain
your own meaningful time plot for

112
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.680
the data set called global temp L in ASA.

113
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.670
The last time series that we'll look
in this lecture is called Star.

114
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.607
It is about the magnitude of a star
at midnight which is collected for

115
00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:40.010
600 consecutive days.

116
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.272
This data is from ASA packet, but
if you look at the documentation using

117
00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:50.534
the health star, it is actually from
the book by Whittaker and Robinson

118
00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:56.345
called The Calculus of Observations,
a Treatise on Numerical Mathematics.

119
00:07:56.345 --> 00:08:01.532
So we plot star data,
and y label and x label,

120
00:08:01.532 --> 00:08:06.722
and we opting following,
time plot which definitely

121
00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:11.820
shows us there is some kind
of seasonality going on.

122
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.650
We can see some periodicity
in this time plot.

123
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.010
So what have you learned in this lecture?

124
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.530
You have learned that time series exist
in a variety of areas starting from

125
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.440
financial world,
ended up with astrophysics.

126
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.440
And you have learned how to
produce meaningful time plots.
