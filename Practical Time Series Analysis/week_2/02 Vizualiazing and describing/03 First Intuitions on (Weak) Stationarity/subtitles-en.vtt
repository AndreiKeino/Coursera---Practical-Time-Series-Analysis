00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.213
In this video lecture,
we will be talking about stationarity.

2
00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:07.481
Objectives is the following.

3
00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:14.769
We would like to get some intuition
about weak stationary time series.

4
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.420
So stationary time series is what we're
going to be building our modules on.

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.296
And what we want in a time series,
is to be stationary.

6
00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:25.300
What it means is the following.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.519
We do not want any systematic
change in the properties and

8
00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.406
the behavior of the time series.

9
00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:35.960
For example, we do not want to have any
systematic change in the mean, right?

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.340
So no systematic change in the mean.

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.060
In other words, we do not want to see
a trend in a stationary time series.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.280
We do not want to see a systematic
change in variation, right?

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.055
So in one of the datasets we looked
at on the Johnson & Johnson,

14
00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:53.206
we saw that there was a change
even in the variation.

15
00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.860
Now for a stationary time series,

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.170
we don't want any systematic
change in the variation.

17
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.700
And we do not want any
periodic fluctuations as well.

18
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.769
So basically, the properties of one
section of a data in a time series

19
00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:11.642
are much like the properties of
the other sections of the data.

20
00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:15.227
To be honest,
usually stationarity's a property of

21
00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:18.743
a stochastic process of a model,
not a time series.

22
00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:23.293
But we say stationary time series
if you think that it can be modeled

23
00:01:23.293 --> 00:01:27.450
with stationary models,
stationary stochastic process.

24
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.711
If we have a non-stationary time series,
which we usually have.

25
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:36.533
What we do,
we basically do some transformations and

26
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.230
we get the stationary time series
after the transformations.

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.374
Once we have a stationary time series,
we model it and

28
00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:49.177
then we go back and
we model our non-stationary time series.

29
00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:51.800
So we use the transformations
as a middle step.

30
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.860
So what have you learned in this lecture?

31
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.831
You have learned that in
a weak stationary time series,

32
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:00.115
there is no systematic change in the mean.

33
00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:01.790
In other words, there is no trend.

34
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.600
There is no systematic change in variance
and there is no periodic variations.
