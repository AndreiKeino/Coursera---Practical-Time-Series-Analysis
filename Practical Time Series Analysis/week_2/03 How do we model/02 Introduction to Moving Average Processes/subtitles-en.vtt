00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.164
In this lecture, we'll be talking about
Introduction to moving average processes.

2
00:00:07.164 --> 00:00:08.501
We only have one objective.

3
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:09.546
Objective is a full living.

4
00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:15.596
We would like to be able to
identify moving average processes.

5
00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:20.397
So, let me give you an intuition
using some stock price example.

6
00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:24.650
Let's say,
Xt is a stock price of some company and

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.208
each daily announcement of
the company to the press,

8
00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:32.262
to the public is modeled as a noise.

9
00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:36.043
So we have Xt which is the price of
the company and then there's a noise,

10
00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:37.502
a noise of announcements.

11
00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:42.891
Noises are the announcements of the
company and let's say, these announcements

12
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.587
are affecting the stock price and
that's the natural thing to assume.

13
00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:52.881
If there is an announcement today, well,
it will have an effect on the stock

14
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:58.360
price and it is possible that effect of
the announcement might last a few days.

15
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.213
Let's say, each announcements
affects my class two days,

16
00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:08.353
then we can think of
stock price as a model.

17
00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:12.692
We can think of the stock price
as a linear combination of

18
00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:15.195
the noises until two days back.

19
00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:18.584
So basically, Zt is the noise today.

20
00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:21.137
Zt-1 is the noise yesterday.

21
00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:25.361
Zt-2 is the noise from other day and

22
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:30.955
all of them contributes
to my stock price today.

23
00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:35.865
Now Zt stand outs when it directly
contributes to the stock price, but

24
00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:38.778
it is possible that yesterday's noise,

25
00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:42.540
yesterday's announcement
might have less effect.

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.632
So, we have a weight on it.

27
00:01:43.632 --> 00:01:49.083
So take the one or take the two would be
weight of announcements from yesterday and

28
00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:54.957
the other day, and this model is basically
one example of a moving average processes.

29
00:01:54.957 --> 00:01:58.162
This is called the moving
average model of order two.

30
00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:03.954
This is called order two,
because we go two dates backs.

31
00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:05.989
Now, you can think of MA(q) model.

32
00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:09.021
Q is the order of moving average model.

33
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:13.840
Zt is a noise,
it contributes to the stock price or Xt.

34
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.353
Zt-1 contributes to Xt and
it can go two days back

35
00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:25.668
as Zt-q also contributes to
the stock price Xt, today.

36
00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:31.040
So basically, Xt is a linear combination
of these noises few days back and

37
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.738
I have theta 1, theta 2, theta q.

38
00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:37.935
These are the weights of the noises
from yesterday and so forth.

39
00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:41.492
And Zis here are basically independent,

40
00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:46.980
identically distributed random
variables and they are modeled

41
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.784
as a normal random variable with
some mean and standard deviation.

42
00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:54.223
So, what have you learned in this lecture?

43
00:02:54.223 --> 00:02:58.798
You have learned how to identify
moving average processes MA(q) where

44
00:02:58.798 --> 00:02:59.780
q is the order.
