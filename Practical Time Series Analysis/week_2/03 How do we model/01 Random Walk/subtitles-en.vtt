1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.480
This lecture is about random walk.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.370
Objectives are the following.

3
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.787
We will get familiar
with random walk model.

4
00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:10.848
We will simulate a random walk model in R.

5
00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:14.237
We will obtain the correlogram
of a random walk, and

6
00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:17.170
we will see a difference
operator in action.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440
The model is the following.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.769
Xt is equal to Xt minus 1 plus Zt.

9
00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.338
So here's how you can interpret this.

10
00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:34.010
Xt can be location of your
particle at this moment.

11
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.788
And Xt minus 1 will be location
of that particle one step before.

12
00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:43.879
In other words, it can be location of
a particle one minute ago or one day ago.

13
00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.124
And Zt is just sound residual,
sound white noise.

14
00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:51.090
The random walk works as following.

15
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.840
Wherever you are,
we just add a little bit of noise to it,

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.190
now you're in the next step.

17
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.489
You add a little bit of noise to it,
now you're in the next step.

18
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.064
There's another interpretation where
you can think Xt is the price of

19
00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:04.298
a stock today, and

20
00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:09.026
Xt minus y was the price of a stock
yesterday, and Zt is the random noise.

21
00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:14.280
So stock is changing from the yesterday's
price by adding some random noise into it.

22
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.215
And this random noise,
which is white noise or residual,

23
00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:25.866
that's just a normal random variable
with some expectation and some variance.

24
00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:33.920
We can assume that maybe
we are starting at point 0.

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.936
At times 0, we are at 0.

26
00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:40.404
Which means that time 1 X1 would be X0,
which is 0,

27
00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:43.524
plus the Z1, so X1 is actually Z1.

28
00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:49.050
And the next times step we are X2,
which has to be X1 plus the Z2.

29
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.105
But X1 is Z1 so it becomes Z1 plus the Z2.

30
00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.120
That's how you go.

31
00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.820
So X3 will become X2, which is Z1 plus
Z2 plus additional noise, which is Z3.

32
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.410
So as you go in this random work,
you accumulate the noises.

33
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.229
So at set T, XT, you basically have
the sum of all noises until time T.

34
00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:19.161
If you look at expectation of Xt,
well it is expectation of sum.

35
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:23.360
And expectation of sum is the same
thing as the sum of expectations.

36
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.101
And since all of Zis are have
the same mean mu, you will get mu t.

37
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:32.470
So expectation is mu t.

38
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.806
Expectation of this stochastic
process is changing by the location.

39
00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:40.860
It is definitely not a stationary process.

40
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.180
And variants of Xt is variants of the sum,
which I wrote as the sum of the variants.

41
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.973
This is only true if the random variables,
the are independent.

42
00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:56.408
So we assume that in our model, that
noises are independent from each other,

43
00:02:56.408 --> 00:03:00.366
which would mean that variance of
the sum is the sum of the variances,

44
00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.428
which will give us signal square t.

45
00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:06.140
So there's systematic change in mean.

46
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.890
There is systematic change in variance.

47
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.835
This is definitely
a non-stationary time series, or

48
00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:13.081
a non-stationary stochastic process.

49
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.270
So let's do a simulation,
in this simulation,

50
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.910
we're going to start from X1 not X0.

51
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.222
X1 is 0 and
our random variable is standard,

52
00:03:23.222 --> 00:03:27.111
our noise is a standard
normal distribution.

53
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:32.976
And we're going to simulate it using a for
loop and we're going to plot it and

54
00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:38.962
we're going to look at the correlation
function of it for the simulation.

55
00:03:38.962 --> 00:03:42.977
So I'm going to say x=NULL, okay.

56
00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:47.838
And that x1, my starting point,
is actually 0.

57
00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:52.474
Then for later on, I have to start from
my previous step add some noise to it.

58
00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:54.863
So I'm going to use for loop.

59
00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:57.160
The syntax is for parentheses.

60
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.370
We do the index i which is n,
starting from 2 until let's say 1,000.

61
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.801
We going to generate 1,000 data points.

62
00:04:06.801 --> 00:04:09.910
I'm going to do the brackets.

63
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.970
Open bracket and
I'm going to close the bracket.

64
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.972
Everything in the bracket will have
a loop, will be inside the loop basically.

65
00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:23.254
And I'm going to say
x[i]=x[i-1]+ some noise, and

66
00:04:23.254 --> 00:04:28.440
the noise we assume to be
standard normal distribution.

67
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.110
So I'm going to say rnorm,
just 1 data point,

68
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.610
because I want to add one noise to it.

69
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.080
And then we generated our beta set.

70
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.483
If I say print(x),
we see that we have thousand,

71
00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.256
thousand, data points.

72
00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:49.060
But it does not have a time
series structure on it.

73
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.190
So let me just go ahead and
clear the console.

74
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.610
And x is a data set, but it doesn't
have a time state structure on it.

75
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.987
So I'm going to define a random walk and
I'm going to say ts.

76
00:05:02.987 --> 00:05:07.850
And ts is going to basically transform
the data set to a time series.

77
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.420
I'm going to put x in it.

78
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.370
And then I have a random walk,
which is basically, time series.

79
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.620
Now let's plot this.

80
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.100
Let's plot random_walk.

81
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.730
Let's out some title to it.

82
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.670
Title would be a random walk.

83
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.070
Into the y label, let's put nothing.

84
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.406
And the x label,
let's say this is basically days.

85
00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:38.870
And let's put some color into it.

86
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.240
We can put a blue color to it, and we
can increase the width of our line by 2.

87
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.303
And once I do that,
we obtain the following.

88
00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:51.949
A random walk.

89
00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:57.804
This is a very,
very typical time plot for a random walk.

90
00:05:57.804 --> 00:06:02.040
Now, random walk we just said,
is not a stationary time series.

91
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.710
It would not make sense to
actually find acf of it,

92
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.061
because acf, we define acf for
stationary time series.

93
00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:15.920
But let's just do it
because we can just do it.

94
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.620
Let's just try to find the acf in r.

95
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.710
If I say acf(random_walk),
we obtain the following plot.

96
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.620
As you see, there's a high correlation,

97
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.180
even 30 laps back,
which just again shows that there is

98
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.080
a high correlation in this data set and
there is no stationality.

99
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.710
Now let's deviate from the topic,
random walk, and

100
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.040
say there is a trend,
definitely trending here.

101
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.050
Goes up and down.

102
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.550
Can you remove that trend?

103
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.930
It turns out that yes we can.

104
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.406
Look at here, look what we have here.

105
00:06:56.406 --> 00:07:02.180
Xt is Xt-1 + Zt, I'm going to take
this Xt-1 to the left hand side.

106
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.045
So basically we have Xt- Xt-1 = Zt.

107
00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:10.523
Let's define Xt- Xt-1 as delta.

108
00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.482
Well, this is not exactly delta,
this is a difference operator.

109
00:07:17.482 --> 00:07:18.497
So let's call it delta Xt.

110
00:07:18.497 --> 00:07:20.619
So this is our difference operator.

111
00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:24.932
So difference operator applied to the Xt,
DXt.

112
00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:28.778
This is a new time series,
which is equal to Zt.

113
00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:30.830
I remember Zt is a random noise.

114
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.460
Zt is a purely random process.

115
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.990
Which means that my difference data
delta Xt is purely random processed,

116
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.280
which is a stationary time series,
which is stationary statistic process.

117
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.160
So it means that if we have a random walk,
simulation for

118
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.140
a random walk,
if we can take difference and

119
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.030
look at the difference,
the difference is going to be stationary.

120
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.470
Let's confirm that using R.

121
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.559
What we begin to do,
we going to use difference operators.

122
00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:07.360
I diff and I write the random walk.

123
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.002
That will give me difference of like 1.

124
00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:14.509
So it's going to give me x2 minus x1,
x3 minus x2,

125
00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:18.195
x4 minus x3 dot dot dot
dot x1000 minus x900.

126
00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:22.143
So this will actually
give me 999 data points.

127
00:08:22.143 --> 00:08:27.170
We are missing one point at the beginning,
but that's all right.

128
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.280
Once I do that, I have another time
series, which is just differences.

129
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.743
For example, I can try to just plot it.

130
00:08:35.701 --> 00:08:39.850
Let me not just put any title on it.

131
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.880
By plotting this, I should get a purely
random process because where you saw

132
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.689
that by just taking xt minus 1 to
the left hand side the difference is Zt.

133
00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:51.510
It is purely [INAUDIBLE] process.

134
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.343
Let's plot this, And

135
00:08:55.343 --> 00:08:59.720
you get what looks like white noise.

136
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.620
Now we can also look at
a acf of the difference.

137
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.190
So, I write acf of the difference
of the random walk.

138
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:16.599
And I look at the difference,
I get an acf, which I have seen before.

139
00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:21.480
This is acf of the purely random process
we generated a few lectures back.

140
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.410
So we just apply difference
operator to remove the trend.

141
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.997
There was some kind of trend going on,
we removed the trend.

142
00:09:29.997 --> 00:09:32.614
By just applying the difference operator,

143
00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:36.020
it'll get the pot of ACF of
the differenced time series.

144
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.770
So what have we learned?

145
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.450
We have learned a random walk model.

146
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.400
We learned how to simulate
a random walk in R.

147
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.000
And we learned how to get
a stationary time series.

148
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.160
In fact, the purely random process
[INAUDIBLE] Random Walk using

149
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.130
difference operator.
