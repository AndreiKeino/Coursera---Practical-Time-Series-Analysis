00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.379
Welcome back to Practical Time Series Analysis,

2
00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.785
and welcome to week two.

3
00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:11.685
Now that we have many of our mathematical and statistical preliminaries out of the way,

4
00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:15.285
we can start engaging actual time series themselves.

5
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.500
So, what we'll do this week is learn how to take advantage of

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.590
the tremendous insights and intuition we can get

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.365
just by doing a simple XY plot for a time series,

8
00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:31.230
looking for trends, seasonality, and other patterns.

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
We'll begin learning how to analyze time series with

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.500
the many functions available to us through R. In particular,

11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.300
we'll start looking at the Autocorrelation Function.

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.980
Now, if you just have a sequence of unrelated data points,

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.935
in essence, if you just have noise,

14
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.290
well, you're not going to see much structure there.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.850
But very often, times series do exhibit

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.560
a relationship between neighbors that we can describe with the Autocorrelation Function.

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.250
And this week, we'll learn how to obtain those and how to start using those.

18
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.335
We can also get a lot of insight into the processes that generate time series,

19
00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:18.065
your so-called Stochastic processes.

20
00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:21.990
If we can write some software simulations ourselves,

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.730
and we begin in week two,

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.310
writing very simple but nonetheless useful,

23
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.470
simulated data, a simulated time series.

24
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.670
So, welcome to week two.
