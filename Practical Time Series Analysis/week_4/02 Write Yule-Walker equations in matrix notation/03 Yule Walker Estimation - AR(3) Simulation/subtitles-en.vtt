00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.200
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.050
In this lecture, we will estimate
model parameters of AR(3) Simulation.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.506
Objective is to estimate
model parameters of simulated

4
00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:16.810
AR(3) process using Yule-Walker
equations in matrix form.

5
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.667
Exactly what we did in a previous lecture,
but this time it's not AR (2),

6
00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:22.799
it's AR (3).

7
00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.636
Now let's look at AR (3), not 2,
AR (3) process with mean 0.

8
00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:30.650
Now we have three terms instead of two.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.936
And in this simulation,
we're going to take p1 as 1 over 3,

10
00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:39.390
p2 as 1 over 2 and
p3 is going to be 7 over 100.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.248
And c1 is going to 4.

12
00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:46.580
Remember the Yule-Walker
equations in the matrix forum.

13
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.740
In this case,
we'll be at three-by-three systems.

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.620
This is our r matrix, this is our b,
the left hand side, and

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.070
this is the coefficients that
we are trying to estimate.

16
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.600
We will solve, we will find inverse of it,
multiply to the left.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.438
And remember Yule-Walker estimator for

18
00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:09.593
sigma square is basically
autocovariance at lag zero.

19
00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:12.659
1 minus the dot product
of the coefficients and

20
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.220
the autocorrelation onto lag p.

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.155
In other words,
the sum of the pi ri, from 1 to p.

22
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.230
Please go ahead and

23
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.860
open up a notebook called AR(3)
simulation parameter estimation.

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.400
And its name here in the notebook is
Yule-Walker Estimation AR(3) Simulation.

25
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.172
So what are we doing?

26
00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:36.101
We are trying to estimate the model
parameters of an some simulations.

27
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:40.159
So we have to simulate first,
this is just like before.

28
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.173
We have set the c to 2017 so

29
00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:46.209
we can reproduce exactly what
we are producing this video.

30
00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.268
Sigma's four, this is our phi,
the coefficients.

31
00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:53.994
And this time we should
take 100,000 data points.

32
00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.670
Let's run the cell.

33
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.930
Let's go to next code block.

34
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.409
We are simulating AR(3) process,
again we are using arima.sim.

35
00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.305
And this time, we have three coefficients.

36
00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:12.440
So it automatically understands that this
is the autoregressive process of order 3.

37
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.615
And n is 100,000.

38
00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:21.450
So we are simulating time series
with 100,000 data points in it.

39
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.110
Let's run.

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.120
So next one,
we define our autocorrelation,

41
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.390
coefficients from 1 to 3, so r1, r2, r3.

42
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.789
Okay, this is our r1,
this is r2, this is r3.

43
00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:42.813
And we define our matrix r and
then we update r accordingly so

44
00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:46.660
we get the r from
the Yule-Walker equation.

45
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.239
And then r becomes basically once in
the main diagonal and it's very symmetric,

46
00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.610
is positive so we have a definite matrix.

47
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.060
This is a base of r1s and this is r2.

48
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.520
We define r matrix vector b
Basically by putting rs as a column.

49
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.500
So this is our b, r1, r2, r3.

50
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.417
And we solve rx = b and

51
00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:22.091
we are getting phi-hat here.

52
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:27.701
And the phi-hat becomes basically 0.34,
0.33,

53
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:32.300
almost 0.5 and this is almost like 0.07,

54
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.130
which is very close to the actual model.

55
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.030
And let's estimate sigma or variance.

56
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.900
And the variance is around 15.97,
which is very close to 16.

57
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.650
And next code block is basically
partitioning the output screen.

58
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.520
And then putting time plot in
a CFN [INAUDIBLE] into three rows.

59
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.510
If we do that, here we go.

60
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.632
So this is our ar3 process,
100,000 data points.

61
00:04:12.632 --> 00:04:18.868
And this is autocorrelation
function which decays eventually.

62
00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:21.350
There's some exponential decay here.

63
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.280
And partial autocorrelation function
has three significant correlations,

64
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.930
lag1, lag2, lag3, and cuts off after lag3,
just like we expected.

65
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.459
Results, we started with
100,000 data points.

66
00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:39.447
Phi1 is estimated at 0.338.

67
00:04:39.447 --> 00:04:42.660
This is phi2, this is phi3,
which is very close.

68
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.310
The actual model is right here.

69
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.441
This is where we started our
simulation and a fitted model is

70
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:55.509
right here where innoations has
variance which is very close to 16.

71
00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.550
And this is our time plot ACF and PACF.

72
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.890
So what have you learned?

73
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.886
We have learned how to estimate
model parameters of ARP processes.

74
00:05:06.886 --> 00:05:11.650
This time it was AR(3) processes using
Yule-Walker equations in a matrix form.

75
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.900
In the next lecture,

76
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.470
we will actually look at the real time
series data [INAUDIBLE] simulation.

77
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.869
And we'll try to fit autoregressive
processes into that dataset
