00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.876
In this lecture we will talk
about difference equations.

2
00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:08.032
This will be again some
kind of preview for

3
00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:13.860
what's coming next which is
doing all kind of equations.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
So, objective is to recall and
solve difference equations.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.210
So, let's start with the sequences.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.260
The general term of a sequence
is sometimes given to us.

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.354
Let's say an is equal to 2n+1.

8
00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:31.502
Then we know every single
term in that sequence, and

9
00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:36.010
we have the general term,
everything is known.

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.290
Sometimes general term of
a sequence is not given with

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.940
some kind of recursive relationship.

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.947
The recursive relation is given to us.

13
00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:51.290
For example, it says an = 5an- 1- 6an- 2.

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.480
And can we use this relation,
recursive relation, to obtain an?

15
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.880
But it turns out that yes we can do it.

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.740
This equation is called a difference
equation, it's a recursive relation.

17
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.290
So, how do you solve these
different equations?

18
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.190
We'll look for a solution in the format
of lambda to the n for some lambda.

19
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.820
So, for example,

20
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.150
in the previous problem we put n equals
the lambda n back into the equation.

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.430
We get lambda to the n, that's a n.

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.100
This is n- 1, this is n- 2, but

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.510
if we divide all sides by
lambda to the n minus 2.

24
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.330
We basically obtain a quadratic equation.

25
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.480
This equation is called
auxiliary equation, or

26
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.130
characteristic equation of
the difference equations.

27
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.575
You can solve for lambda.

28
00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:42.985
Lambda is either 2 or 3.

29
00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:45.550
That means we might have
two different solutions.

30
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.680
2 to the n is one type of solution,
3 to the n is another type of solution,

31
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.440
and we can look at their
linear combination.

32
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.520
And an is going to be basically your
linear combination of these two solutions.

33
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.640
The thing is we don't know what c1 c2 is.

34
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.840
We have to find c1, c2 depending on
some constraints like initial data.

35
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.060
Let's say a0 was 3 when we started,
and a1 was 8.

36
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.685
Then, we can put 0 into the n to get
the c1 + c2 which is actually 3.

37
00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:23.660
And since a1 is 8, we can put 1
into the n to get 2c1 + 3c2 = 8.

38
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.350
And to solve the system of equation,
we found that c1 = 1, c2 = 2.

39
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.740
Then we can find a solution an,

40
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.326
which is basically 1 times 2
to the n + 2 x 3 to the n.

41
00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:40.070
This is the general term of
the sequence that solves the 2nd

42
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.710
order difference equation
that we started with.

43
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.170
It's called 2nd order difference equation,
because we're going two steps back an-2,

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.659
and whenever we have -2 this is
2nd order difference equation.

45
00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.880
In general k-th order difference
equations going to have an as a linear

46
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.562
combination of the k-th steps back,
and its characteristic

47
00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:10.166
equation would be obtained by
choosing an as lambda to the n.

48
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.832
And if we simplify we get lambda to the k
minus beta 1 lambda k minus 1 and so

49
00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:15.660
forth.

50
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.599
This equation is called
the characteristic equation.

51
00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.830
Usually this is a k degree polynomial.

52
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.030
It has to have a k solution,
some of them complex, some of them real.

53
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.230
If you have all distinct real solutions,
let's say, and this is one special case.

54
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.257
This polynomial has all
distinct real roads.

55
00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:44.774
Then we can write an as the linear
combination of lambda 1 to the n and

56
00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:46.850
2 to the n and so forth.

57
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.740
And these coefficients are determined
using some initial values.

58
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.236
Let's look at a famous example
of Fibonacci sequence.

59
00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:57.280
The Fibonacci sequence
is defined as follows.

60
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.617
You start, let's say with one, the next
guy's one, so first two are known,

61
00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:02.350
one and one.

62
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.664
Then every next term in the sequence
is sum of the previous two terms.

63
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.280
In other words, one, one,
add them up, next guy's two.

64
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.683
And then look at the last two guys, one,
and two, add them up and get three.

65
00:04:14.683 --> 00:04:18.140
Look at the last two, two and
three add them up you get five.

66
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.150
Three plus five is eight.

67
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.744
5 plus 8 is 13.

68
00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:23.980
13 plus 8 is 21, and so forth.

69
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.300
And every term starting from the third
term is basically addition of

70
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.840
the previous two terms.

71
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.770
The question is can be found,

72
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.940
can we find the general term
an of the Fibonacci sequence?

73
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.630
Well, let's formulate this.

74
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.320
We are looking for a sequence an such
that an is equal to an-1 + an-2,

75
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.705
our previous two terms.

76
00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:49.170
Starting from n=2.

77
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.419
And let's say a0 is 1 and a1 is 1.

78
00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.255
So, first two terms in the sequence is 1,
and

79
00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:03.466
you have the and
as a function of an+1, an-1+an-2.

80
00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:06.752
To find a characteristic equation
it's going to be lambda squared,

81
00:05:06.752 --> 00:05:09.881
it's the second altered difference
equation, lambda square.

82
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.034
Minus lambda, we can take this, the left
hand side minus lambda, minus one, and

83
00:05:13.034 --> 00:05:14.420
that comes up with a zero.

84
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.728
We solved for the roots of this quadratic
equation, and we get lambda1 and lambda2.

85
00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:24.533
That means that an can be written as the
linear combination of lambda1 to the n and

86
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.674
lambda2 to the n.

87
00:05:25.674 --> 00:05:27.914
Then we have to use the initial data.

88
00:05:27.914 --> 00:05:29.802
A0 was 1.

89
00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:33.642
In other words, if I plug 0 here,
we get c1 + c2 equal to 1.

90
00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:34.901
A1 was 1.

91
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.661
I put 1 and 1 here.

92
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.911
And then this sum has to be equal to 1.

93
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:43.820
We solve the system of equation, and then
we find c1 is equal to this expression,

94
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.823
c2 is equal to this expression.

95
00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:47.871
We write them back into the an.

96
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:54.089
An becomes this expression here,
which is -1 over radical 5,

97
00:05:54.089 --> 00:06:00.543
lambda 1 to the n + 1,
1 over radical 5 lambda, 2 to the n +1.

98
00:06:00.543 --> 00:06:05.606
Okay, so this is how we
solve a difference equation.

99
00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:07.957
And it can actually relate to
these differential equations.

100
00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:10.390
K to the ordinary differential equation.

101
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.440
Linear ordinary differential
equation is in this format.

102
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.370
The k derivative is some function
of linear function of the previous

103
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.390
derivatives with some extra
term here without any function.

104
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.200
And the way we solve this.

105
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.353
We start with a general format,
e to the lambda t.

106
00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:34.052
And we are trying to find
the solution like e to the lambda t.

107
00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:35.658
If we plugged them in,

108
00:06:35.658 --> 00:06:41.180
we obtain exact same characteristic
equation that we obtained before.

109
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.930
So, for lambda, we take the linear
combination of e to the lambda t.

110
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.540
Okay, so what have we learned?

111
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.364
We have learned the definition of the
different equations, which is one term of

112
00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:59.187
the linear combination of a few
other terms, previous terms.

113
00:06:59.187 --> 00:07:02.276
And we learned how to solve them by
looking at the format lambda to the end

114
00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:04.090
and finding the characteristic equation
