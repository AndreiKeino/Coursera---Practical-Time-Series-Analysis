00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.210
In this lecture, we will talk
about backward shift operator.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.750
Objective is the following.

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.690
We're going to define and
utilize backward shift operator.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.046
So, let's start.

5
00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:15.260
We have a stochastic process,
X1, X2, X3, and so forth.

6
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.850
Each one of these guys
are random variables.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.748
And we define backward shift
operator as a follow up.

8
00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:27.800
B is our backward shift operator,
and we'll take Xt, and

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.390
we'll take it back one step,
which will take it back one lambda.

10
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.622
So, BXt will go to Xt-1.

11
00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:40.938
In other words, if you have B squared Xt,
B squared is defined

12
00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:46.155
B applying backward shift operator twice,
so we have BBXt,

13
00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:52.519
BXt is going to be Xt-1, and if take
one step back you going to go to Xt-2.

14
00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:59.686
In other words B to the k Xt, Im sorry,
B to the k Xt going to the Xt-k.

15
00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:05.450
With the Xt, I would take it
back k steps and let's use it.

16
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.850
So, this is the definition of
the backward shift operator, so

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.690
how can we utilize this?

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.260
We're going to do the following.

19
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.990
Think of the random walk right this is one
of our examples we have talked about it.

20
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810
Basically you start
from the previous step,

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.130
and you add some random
disturbance to it right.

22
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.087
Zt is our random disturbance, or
you know bayesian, or white noise,

23
00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:31.043
and then we go to the Xt, in other words
we can write actually Xt as sum of

24
00:01:31.043 --> 00:01:35.764
the equations of the whole past
innovations, all disturbances.

25
00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:40.750
Xt-1 can be expressed as BXt,
that's backwards shift operator.

26
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.940
And we take the Xt to the left-hand side,
and pull out Xt, so

27
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.080
that we get another operator 1-B is
going to be our polynomial operator.

28
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.115
1 is basic identity 1Xt,
Xt, or 1-B will give you

29
00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.854
(1-B)Xt will give us Xt-Xt-1.

30
00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:04.310
We define (1- B) by phi B.

31
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.890
And then phi (B)Xt becomes Zt.

32
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.830
So, by using back work shift operator
we rewrite random walk in this format.

33
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.980
This is a MA(2) process.

34
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.270
One example of MA(2) process
is it goes back two steps.

35
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.956
You see this is, the basically,
sum weighted sum,

36
00:02:21.956 --> 00:02:27.150
of the three innovations,

37
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.260
right, the present random noise,
the previous random noise, and

38
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.640
then the random noise in lack two, and
they all add it up to give the Xt stack.

39
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.178
Today, that's Xt.

40
00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:42.488
So, how come you neutralize
backward chief operator here.

41
00:02:42.488 --> 00:02:49.109
Instead of Zt-1, we can write BZt, and
instead of Zt-2 we can write B squared Zt.

42
00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.090
Now, everybody has Zt in it.

43
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.438
We can kind of pull out Zt,
and all polynomial operator,

44
00:02:55.438 --> 00:02:59.069
which we call beta B
is going to be 1+0.2B.

45
00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.710
Plus 0.04B squared.

46
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.832
Now, we write this MA(2) process
in this format, Xt = Beta(B)Zt,

47
00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:10.562
where Beta(B) is actually
a polynomial operator.

48
00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:18.490
We can utilize backwards shift
operator in AR(2) processes.

49
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.370
So, this is our Xt,
a regressed on two previous

50
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.420
lags with some random disturbance,
innovation, or white noise at that step.

51
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.657
And instead of Xt minus 1,
we can write BXt,

52
00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:36.769
Xt minus 2 to write B square Xt take
these two terms to the left outside,

53
00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.477
pull out Xt, we have polynomial
operator we call this phi(B).

54
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:44.640
So, we write this as phi(B)Xt = Zt.

55
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.516
But what is our phi(B)?

56
00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:50.271
Phi(B) is basically polynomial operator
in terms of the backward shift operator.

57
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:54.894
It is 1- 0.2B- 0.3B squared.

58
00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:59.496
In general, if you look at MA(q)
processes, moving average processes, for

59
00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:02.370
their q, assessing there's some drift.

60
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.670
Mu is our drift,
our expectation of Xt, in other words.

61
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.490
And Xt is equal to, it's drift plus

62
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.770
basically the linear combination
of the random noises.

63
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.980
Q steps back, q lags back instead of Xt,
I write Zt instead of Zt -1, we write BZt.

64
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.070
Instead of Zt minus q,
we can write this BqZt.

65
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.650
We can pull out Zt,
put the drift to the left-hand side.

66
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.760
I have Xt minus mu is equal to
polynomial operator acting on Zt.

67
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.410
And this polynomial operator is
basically phi 0 + phi 1 B + phi q B q.

68
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.799
Okay, so let me just mention that
these phis are actually not phis,

69
00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:49.375
this is a typo, it is our basically
Beta 0, Beta 1, Beta q to the end.

70
00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:56.620
Okay, If you have AR(p) processes,
basically Xt is

71
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.430
regressed on the previous P steps
of the same stochastic process,

72
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.465
plus some random noise,
we can use, backwards shifht and

73
00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:12.135
put all these terms to the left, and come
up with the format, phi(B)Xt equals Zt.

74
00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:16.432
Where phi(B) is the backwards shift, I'm
sorry, it's a polynomial for each ratio.

75
00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.855
The back ration is 1-phi 1b and so forth.

76
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.040
So, what have we learned?

77
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.590
We have learned the definition
of backward shift operator,

78
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.130
which we will use a lot later on as well.

79
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.009
And we used how to utilize backward shift
operator to write MA(q) processes and

80
00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:35.310
AR(p) processes.
