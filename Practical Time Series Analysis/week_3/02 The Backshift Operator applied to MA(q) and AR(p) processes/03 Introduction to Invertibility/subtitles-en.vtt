00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.052
In this lecture, we will take about
invertibility of stochastic processes.

2
00:00:04.052 --> 00:00:08.063
It's going to be Introduction
to Invertibility.

3
00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:13.385
So objective is to learn invertibility
of a stochastic process.

4
00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:17.963
So let's look at these Two MA(1),
Moving Average of all through one models.

5
00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:20.825
Model 1 is Xt = Zt + 2Zt-1,

6
00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:25.918
Model 2 will have instead of
2 will have half of Zt-1.

7
00:00:25.918 --> 00:00:27.931
So what we want to do first,

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.495
we'd like to point out the covariance
function of model one.

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.603
What is the definition of
auto covariance function?

10
00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:43.080
Gamma (k) is basically covariance,
with an Xt plus k and Xt, right?

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.820
So, basically the gamma (k) depends
on the difference between the steps,

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.470
not Xt, not Xt + k.

13
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.660
But k, the number of the lags in
between those two random variables.

14
00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.365
And we put the definition of Xt + k
into it for model 1 and xt and three

15
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:05.455
which ez plus 2 zt minus 1 and then we try
to use the covariance, we expand this.

16
00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:08.665
Now the recipe takes the covariance
of zt plus k with the zt,

17
00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:11.765
zt plus k with zt minus 1.

18
00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:16.555
This term, with zt and
the same term with 2 zt minus 1.

19
00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.985
Now realize the full level,
if k is greater than 1,

20
00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:23.300
which would mean that t plus k minus
1 is greater than t, in other words,

21
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.510
these guys are actually uncorrelated.

22
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.190
There is no covary that
correlates the 0 between them.

23
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.360
In other words, if k is greater than 1,
our gamma k is 0.

24
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.990
This is
Theoretical Auto Covariance Function.

25
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.380
Now if k is 0, exactly 0, that would
mean we are looking at gamma 0, right.

26
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.000
And gamma 0 is basically the variance,
the variance of this expression.

27
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.840
And we can see that this is
basically covariance Zt Zt,

28
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.880
and covariance Zt Z2- 1 is going to
be 0 because they are uncorrelated.

29
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.460
Zt- 1, Zt will be 0, but that Zt-
1 will have another variance here.

30
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.130
The first Covariant will be most Gamma.

31
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.120
I'm sorry Sigma squared and

32
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.080
this one another Sigma squared and
then we'll get five Sigma squared.

33
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.270
The Sigma is standard deviation
of the disturbance for

34
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.590
k = 1, we write the definition of xt + 1,

35
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.300
which is Zt+1 + 2Zt, we expand it,

36
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.290
there's only correlated guys are 2Zt and
Zt, and that will give us 2 sigma square.

37
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.340
If k is negative of course, gamma k,

38
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.350
this is the covariance,
it's even function of K, so

39
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.770
gamma K is same thing as gamma negative K
.So if i write auto covariance function.

40
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.810
Auto covariance function looks like
this starting problem from lag two so

41
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.850
great than lag one.

42
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.210
Starting with Lag 2.

43
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.748
We have n covariance, no auto covariance.

44
00:02:56.748 --> 00:03:01.380
K1, in other words, the conveyors
would like one and two sigmas squared.

45
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.840
And then the covariance with
itself is five sigma squared.

46
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.240
And then for negative one,
we just the symmetric.

47
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.090
This is gamma negative K.

48
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.580
And if I want to find out the correlation
fun, function, in other words, A,

49
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.425
C, F,
all I have to do is basically divide.

50
00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:21.620
Gamma (k) to gamma (0), that's the
definition of auto correlation function.

51
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.040
And the gamma (k) is basically,
I divided everything by 5 sigma squared.

52
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.270
This becomes 0.

53
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.670
This becomes 2 / 5, 1 and
this is auto correlation for -k.

54
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.900
So this is our auto correlation function.

55
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.360
So if I graph this we have autocorrelation
always at lag 0 which is self

56
00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:47.760
the XT has a correlation 1 with itself,
of course.

57
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.730
And then we have some
autocorrelation in lag 1, then it.

58
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.670
Right?
This is basically a famous picture for

59
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.150
An ACF of an MA model.

60
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.660
If you have MA1 model, then ACF has
to cut off starting from one on.

61
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.260
Okay, now if I look at all
the correlation part of model 2, so

62
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.890
I'm going to skip a few steps here.

63
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.800
If we are concentrated on rho 1,

64
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.580
the correlation with other
correlation with lag one.

65
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.280
This is gamma 1 over gamma 0.

66
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.660
This is all gamma 1, this is gamma 0.

67
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.360
instead of 2s now we have halves.

68
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.610
If we calculate this, it becomes 2 over 5.

69
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.680
So if you write ACF of the model 2,
we get exactly the same ACF of model 1.

70
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.180
So if we have now two different models
Model 1, Model 2, they only differ with

71
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.020
this coefficient 2 and a half, but both of
them has an ACF which is exactly the same.

72
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.010
Now, if you are trying to
model a time series, and

73
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.880
if you believe that ACF
[INAUDIBLE] at some point,

74
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.690
then you try to model it with MAQ models,
right, MA 1, MA 2.

75
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.490
But, if ACF, a few more and

76
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.970
make queue process would have the same
ACF that would be problematic to model.

77
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.920
So we would like to somehow eliminate
one of these models in some way.

78
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.670
So ACFs are same, there's exactly
the same ACF, Model 1 and Model 2.

79
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.430
Okay.

80
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.010
So let's pause that thought a little bit.

81
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.860
So we're going to come back and
eliminate one of those models.

82
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.930
But how you're going to eliminate.

83
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.750
So let's talk about this invertibility,
inverting.

84
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.680
So what are we going to do,
we going to take general MA1 process now

85
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.910
that we have Xt which is equal
to Zt plus some beta and

86
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.670
our models beta was either half or
two, okay.

87
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.290
What we're going to do.

88
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.150
We're going to find Zt from here, so
Zt is going to basically Xt- beta Z- 1.

89
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.310
All right, but then instead of Zt- 1,

90
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.930
we will use the same relation,
this precursor relation.

91
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.870
Instead of Zt- 1, if we use this.

92
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.410
Put t instead of t minus.

93
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.942
Instead of t put t-1,
this is going to be Xt-1, beta Zt-2, and

94
00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:59.520
replace Zt-1 with that expression.

95
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.470
And expand it.

96
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.028
We get Xt minus beta Xt-1,
plus beta squared Zt-2.

97
00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:10.136
In other words,
Zt now is expressed as Xt and

98
00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:13.760
Xt-1, plus some In step 2.

99
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.290
And then we can continue.

100
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.220
Instead of zt2.

101
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.540
We can put again, xt minus 2 minus beta.

102
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.050
Xz t minus 3, and so forth.

103
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.680
We can continue with this,
in theory, until infinity.

104
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.120
Then we'll, sorry.

105
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.780
So we can continue this until infinity.

106
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.530
What do we obtain?

107
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:40.260
We obtain Zt is equal to Xt- Bxt- 1
+ B squared xt- 2- B cubed xt- 3.

108
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.430
And it goes on and on and on.

109
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.350
Right?
So what does this mean?

110
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.366
Now the rest if you find xt here, xt = zt

111
00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:55.820
+ linear combination, but this is series,
it's not a linear combination anymore.

112
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:03.910
Infinite series, and xt is on every
exterior value in the past, right.

113
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.030
So you can think of this AR processes
are the regressive process.

114
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.690
But the order, well it doesn't matter, the
order is infinity, this is AR infinity.

115
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.420
Process.

116
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.930
So what did we do?

117
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:23.130
Well, we kind of inverted MA(1) process
into other with order infinity.

118
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.320
Here's the one thing you have to
keep in mind, this is a series here,

119
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.870
there's an infinite series here.

120
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.980
And whenever we see an infinite series,

121
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.000
we have to Keep in mind that it might be
convergent or divergent,you have to make

122
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.192
sure that is actually
convergent in some sense.

123
00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:45.610
Okay, now I'm going repeat the same
thing using Backward shift operator,

124
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.730
let's utilize Backward shift operator.

125
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.209
For Ma1 process, Xt can be written as
Beta(B)Zt, and where is my Beta(B)?

126
00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:55.940
Beta(B) is basically 1 + Beta B.

127
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.660
That's our polynomial operator acting on
Zt, and that will give us Ma1 process.

128
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.590
Now, I would like to somehow
write Zt in terms of Xt.

129
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.830
So what am I going to do?

130
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.620
I'm going to find inverse operator So

131
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.270
if the Beta B is our polynomial operator,
somehow if I can find inverse operator,

132
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.470
and put in the inverse operator
into the left-hand side,

133
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.360
then Zt is expressed some
inverse operator, acting on Xt.

134
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.840
In other words,
Zt will be expressed in terms of Xts.

135
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.950
Okay.

136
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.870
So what is a Beta B inverse?

137
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.510
Well, Beta B is 1 plus Beta B.

138
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.140
And we can write this as
1 over 1 plus Beta B.

139
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.000
This is not fraction.

140
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.350
This is basically inverse
operator of 1 plus Beta B.

141
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.990
And what we're going to
do is the following.

142
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:51.850
We're going to act like this Beta B Is
a complex number for a minute.

143
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.160
Assume that it's not actually an operator.

144
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.640
It's a complex number.

145
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.790
Think of z, and then expand this.

146
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.260
This is the usual geometric expansion.

147
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.490
This is geometric series.

148
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.645
1 minus r plus r squared minus, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.950
1 R, R is negative beta B.

150
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.790
So it's going to be 1 plus R
plus R square plus R cubed but

151
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.750
then since I have 1 minus negative
beta B here sign will alternate.

152
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.360
So this is our inverse operator and

153
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.720
if we act this operator this
Z inverse operator on our X,

154
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.150
T then we will obtain well one Well,
this is not really one.

155
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.140
This is Xt, so this is a typo here.

156
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.562
This operator is acting on Xt,
1 acting on Xt.

157
00:09:35.562 --> 00:09:41.500
The Xt, and then this is going to
give us Xt minus 1 and so forth.

158
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:47.140
In either way we invert that
Ma1 process into ar infinity.

159
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:55.480
And we express Zt as infinite sum of Xts
with some weight in front of them, right?

160
00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.687
So how do we make sure that this
series is actually convergent series?

161
00:10:03.528 --> 00:10:07.621
Well it turns out That that series
is convergent in some sense,

162
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.398
this is random variables,

163
00:10:09.398 --> 00:10:14.280
adding them up, so we have to talk
about convergence of random variables.

164
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.630
This is not usual sequence, series.

165
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.310
It is random variables involved here.

166
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:24.630
There's this notion called mean-square
convergence Which is an option that

167
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.620
medial will be there about
this mean square root is.

168
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.790
But we actually proved this resolved.

169
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.500
But for now let's use this as a black box.

170
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.830
This series is convergent.

171
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.960
It means squared tens.

172
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.400
If and only if absolute value of beta,

173
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:49.130
absolute value of beta is less than Okay
let's get a definition of invertibility.

174
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.540
In general,
it make t as a stochastic process.

175
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.520
It doesn't have to be [INAUDIBLE].

176
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.750
Xt is a stochastic process and
think of Z is a notation right?

177
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.600
It's random disperse of
white noise [INAUDIBLE].

178
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.630
They say Xt is invertible.

179
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.090
If Zt can be expressed as infinite series.

180
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.330
Pie K, Xt minus k.

181
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.080
K goes from zero to infinity.

182
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.800
This is like AR infinity process,

183
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.950
where This pk is the sum of the absolute
value of pk's is convergent.

184
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.790
Now there was a series just of
pk's are absolutely convergent.

185
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.820
This is the definition of
invertibility of a stochastic process.

186
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.360
Now in our model one,
let's go back to our model one, model two.

187
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.240
Remember those are the two models we have.

188
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.990
It's tame ACF who wants
to eliminate one of them.

189
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:50.650
If you look at model one our pi
k going to be since beta is 2,

190
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.640
it's going to be sum of 2 the k.

191
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.280
And this series really diverges here.

192
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.110
But if you look at Model 2,
the [INAUDIBLE] case is 1 over 2.

193
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.810
If you look at some of the 1 over
2 to the k, we talked about this,

194
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.140
this is a geometric series, and
it is a convergence series.

195
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.850
So what are we going to do?

196
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.110
We're going to eliminate Model 1 and
go with Model 2.

197
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.280
Somehow we will assume
that we would like to

198
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.330
have our model to have
something worth splitting.

199
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.680
Okay, so model choice.

200
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.160
For invertibility to hold,

201
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.840
we choose Model 2 since the absolute
value 1 over 2 is less than 1.

202
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.480
In this way,

203
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.610
our ACF uniquely determines the MA
process that we've been looking for.

204
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.140
So what have you learn?

205
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.600
You have learned that definition of
invertibility of a stochastic process.

206
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.310
And then we learned the invertibility
condition Guarantees that

207
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.390
unique MA process corresponding to
the observed Author Correlation Function,

208
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.330
in other words, ACF.
