00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.890
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.620
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.755
In this lecture we will be talking
about series and series representation.

4
00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.890
This will be something like
a little review for some people.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.660
So let's dive into it.

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.540
If you're the objectives
are the following.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.020
We would like to recall infinite
series and their convergence.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
We would like examine geometric series and

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.320
represent rational functions
as a geometric series.

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.180
So let's start with the sequence first.

11
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.340
The sequence is basically a list
of numbers in some definite order.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.856
If the limit of this sequence exists.

13
00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:47.387
To a as n gets larger and larger, then
we say that the sequence is convergent.

14
00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:51.195
So, let me use some examples a n
= n / n+1, as an increase you can

15
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.879
see that these numbers are getting
closer and closer to the one.

16
00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.490
If you look at a n = 3 to the n.

17
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.232
Which is basically 3, and then 9 and 27.

18
00:01:00.232 --> 00:01:03.130
It goes larger and larger,
it does not converge.

19
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.990
In that case actually
we say it's divergent.

20
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.190
It diverges to infinity.

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.450
n equal to radical n, because 1,
radical 2, radical 3,

22
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.870
radical n, it still increases.

23
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.900
It may not that passed as n or
n squared, or three to the n, but

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.500
it does increase to infinity so
it's also a divergent sequence.

25
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.150
Like if I look at one over n squared,
it's going to be one, one over four,

26
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.020
one over nine,
eventually it will decrease to zero.

27
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.370
Now partial sums of a sequence
n are defined as follows.

28
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.420
You look at first n
the terms in the sequence.

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.310
We add them up.

30
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.240
And that becomes our end partial sum.

31
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
We call it sn.

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.700
For example, s1 is the first a1.

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.310
And then we look at the s2,
which is a1 + a2.

34
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.240
s3, which is a1 + a2 + a3.

35
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.210
So we keep adding.

36
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.020
The terms from the sequence, and
then we make a new sequence.

37
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.900
So we now have a partial sums, s1,
s2, s3, which is a new sequence.

38
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.710
And here's the part that
serious coming to the play.

39
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.590
If this partial sums a sense are actually
going closer and closer to some number,

40
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.440
then we say the series, a1 + a2 +
a3 plus dot, dot, dot to infinity,

41
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.880
in other words that infinite
sum is convergent and

42
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.850
it is equal to that limit, s,
which is the limit of the partial sums.

43
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.440
And we write sum notation from
cables from one to infinity,

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.760
ak, it's the limit of a partial sum and
it's s.

45
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.590
Now if.

46
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.500
The partial sums do not converge.

47
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.110
In other words, if the sequence s n
is broken then it was the series a k,

48
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.040
k equals one from infinite sum and
up, it is a divergent series.

49
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.012
So let m give this common example of
the Series one went to the case if you

50
00:02:53.012 --> 00:02:58.093
add them up, it becomes number one if
you add them one of the case requires

51
00:02:58.093 --> 00:03:01.182
If this is some of the number
chi square over six.

52
00:03:01.182 --> 00:03:06.974
If you -1 to the the k + 1 / k, which
is called alternating harmonic series,

53
00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.515
it because some number ln(2).

54
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:14.014
But there are also some divergencies
occurs if you'll have this sequence,

55
00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:14.725
3 to the k.

56
00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:17.782
If you keep adding them up,
you can think if it piles up and

57
00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:20.057
it doesn't converge to sum number.

58
00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:24.135
Sum of 3 to the k, sum of 2k + 1,
which is sum of odd numbers.

59
00:03:24.135 --> 00:03:30.330
Or even sum of 1/ks,
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 and so forth.

60
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.270
As a sequence, one over k goes to zero,
but if you sum them up,

61
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.070
they pile up and it becomes divergent.

62
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.650
This last series here is
actually called harmonic series.

63
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.600
Now, we say series is absolutely
convert it and if you take the absolute

64
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.270
value of each perm in the sequence and
add them up and if it turns out this

65
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.040
new series is convergent then the original
series is called absolutely convergent.

66
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.920
Now one thing we have to mention
is that absolute convergence

67
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.490
is actually a stronger convergence
implies convergence as well.

68
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.950
There are a lot of convergence tests
out there where we use them to test

69
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.120
a series of convergence, of divergent,
because finding partial sums and

70
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.860
the limit of the partial sums is
not as efficient most of the time.

71
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.030
So we use some tests to determine

72
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.190
the convergence of a series, which I'm
not going to talk about in this lecture.

73
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.510
There's one important series which
we're going to lose a lot in this week,

74
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.230
is a geometric series.

75
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.690
And let's start with
the geometric sequence first,

76
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.990
geometric sequence is the following
you start with a number and

77
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.850
you keep multiplying with some r,
so you start with a,

78
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.000
next guy is a r, next guy is a r squared,
next guy is a r cubed, and so forth.

79
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.070
If you add them up, if you add these
numbers up, infinitely many of them,

80
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.760
you get this geometric series.

81
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.350
And it turns out that geometric series is
sometimes convergent sometimes divergent.

82
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.010
When is it convergent?

83
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.790
It is convergent if it's multiplier
r absolute value less than one,

84
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.690
have magnitude less than one.

85
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.229
So let me give you an example.

86
00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.380
We talked about sum of one over two
to k it's right it's right here.

87
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.700
Sum of one over two to k.

88
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.300
The first guys 1 over 2,
then 1 over 4, 1 over 8.

89
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.050
It is a geometric series.

90
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.760
The starting number, a, is 1 over 2,
and the number you're multiplying,

91
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.600
r, is actually half,
which has magnitude less than 1.

92
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.360
Absolute value of r is less than 1.

93
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.021
Which means this is going to be
a convergent geometric series, and

94
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:44.936
you can use the formula a over 1-4, and

95
00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:49.701
it becomes 1 over 2 over 1 minus 1 over 2,
which is actually 1.

96
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:53.449
So this whole sum sums
up to actually 1 series

97
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.400
Now, series representation
is very important.

98
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.980
What we do is here is a.

99
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.470
If you have some rational function,
let's say you have 1 over 1- x.

100
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.390
Can we express this rational function
as a series, as a geometric series?

101
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.770
It turns out that, yes,
we can try to use our geometric series.

102
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.680
So how do we do this?

103
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.980
In this expression you can realize
that you can think of 1 as your a,

104
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.320
and r as your x.

105
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.690
Then 1 over 1- x is your a + AR,

106
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.490
which is x, + AR squared,
which is x squared, and so forth.

107
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.590
So we can express 1 over 1- x,
as infinite series but

108
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.240
this equality will be only true for
some values of x because geometric series.

109
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.840
In other words, this geometric
series will always work if that

110
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.210
absolute value of r is x is less than 1.

111
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.840
In other words 1/1-x Is
equal to this infinite sum,

112
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.020
if and only if,
absolute value of x is less than 1.

113
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.384
You can find series representation for

114
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.539
rational functions in
the format of the following.

115
00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.421
You can 1 over sum 1
over x times 1- x over k.

116
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.419
In other words,
we have some quadratic equation,

117
00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.660
quadratic polynomial denominator.

118
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.750
What we can do with the following, we can
expand this using partial fractions and

119
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.850
then each one,
they'll give us a geometric series and

120
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.710
we connect this to geometric series
to get one series expansion.

121
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.170
Now both of these expansions
must be convergent.

122
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.290
In other words,
absolute value x has to be < 1,

123
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.270
absolute value of x / 2 has to be < 1.

124
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.200
In other words, absolute value of x
has to be < 1 is the common interval.

125
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.621
As long as absolute value of x is < 1,

126
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:55.409
this rational function can be expressed
as an infinite series right here.

127
00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:02.404
We can actually jump to the complex
functions if instead of actually

128
00:08:02.404 --> 00:08:06.630
have a z which is a complex number,
same expansion holds.

129
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:12.180
In other words, a/1- z can be
written as a geometric series.

130
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:19.110
But this geometric series will be
only convergent if Magnitude of z.

131
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.800
This is an absolute value
[INAUDIBLE] is that the magnitude

132
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.160
of the complex number is less than one.

133
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.710
So the same idea works here as well.

134
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.180
So what is we have
learned in this lecture?

135
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.160
We have learned the definition
of the infinite series and

136
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.010
when they're actually convergent.

137
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.650
We have learned that Geometric series of
conversion if the multiplier has norm

138
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.770
is another word for
magnitude in our case is less that 1.

139
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.540
And you learn how to represent some
rational functions as a geometric series.
