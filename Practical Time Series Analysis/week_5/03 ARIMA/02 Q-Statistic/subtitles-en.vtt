00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.880
Hello everyone in this election we will
talk about the Ljung-Box Q-statistic.

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.536
So objective is to define
Ljung-Box Q-statistic.

3
00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:13.932
Will learn how their the decision
rule to test an null

4
00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:18.577
hypothesis that the several
autocorrelation coefficients are zero.

5
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:22.875
And we'll learn how to test the null
hypothesis that several autocorrelation

6
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:24.643
coefficients are zero using R.

7
00:00:24.643 --> 00:00:28.221
Let me tart with Portmanteau
statistic in 1970,

8
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:33.157
Box and Pierce proposed the following
statistic which is just Q*(m).

9
00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:38.425
It is the time,t he length of
the time series is multiplied

10
00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:45.860
with the sum of the squares of the sample
of the correlation coefficients until m.

11
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.210
And they propose this for testing
the null hypothesis that more than one.

12
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.340
Let's say m many of the correlation
coefficient zero against the alternative

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.440
hypothesis that there is some rho i for
i in between one and m that's not zero.

14
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.750
So either all of them are zero or

15
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.780
against that there's at least one
of these guys that's not zero and

16
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.870
they used Q*(m) statistic to
test this null hypothesis.

17
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.671
They showed that under some
conditions Q*(m) has asymptotically

18
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:27.710
Chi-Squared distribution,
with degrees of freedom m.

19
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.900
Then Ljung and Box in 1978,
they modified this statistics

20
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.610
to increase the power of the test for
a finite samples.

21
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.090
And there test is that
Q(m) is equal to now.

22
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.340
The length of the time series*(the
length of the time series+2)*the sum,

23
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.130
this time the sum is
actually divided by T-l.

24
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.865
Decision rule is going
to be the following.

25
00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:53.942
We're going to look at the Q(m) and

26
00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:58.714
if Q(m) is large enough then we reject
the null hypothesis, now how large enough?

27
00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:03.210
Well if it is larger than 100(1-
alpha) quantile in the Chi-Squared

28
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.170
distribution with m degrees of freedom.

29
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.876
Now most packages actually
give you the p-value.

30
00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:12.903
So we're going to reject
the null hypothesis if p value is

31
00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.396
sufficiently small.

32
00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:18.610
So if p value is less than some alpha,
let's say alpha is 0.05, our significance

33
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.260
level you're going to reject that the idea
that there is no auto-correlation.

34
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.603
Now how are are we going to use this?

35
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:29.121
Well, when we start with this time
series's were going to use this q

36
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:32.330
statistic to see if there
is autocorrelation.

37
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.980
Then if there is autocorrelation
were going to try to fit our models.

38
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.360
And once they fit the model then there
will be residuals hopefully a white nulls.

39
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.040
Now then we're going to
look at the residuals,

40
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.010
we shouldn't see n alpha correlation.

41
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.890
So we're going to use this test for

42
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.500
the residuals to see if there's
a autocorrelation or not as well.

43
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.830
Now the question is what is this m?

44
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.819
How large do we take m?

45
00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.200
It is usually taking as the lower than ln,
of the length of the time series.

46
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.290
And in the R,
we're going to use this Box.test routine

47
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.099
to actually carry out
all of our calculations.

48
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.964
So what have we learned?

49
00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:20.284
We have learned the definition
of the Ljung-Box Q-statistic.

50
00:03:20.284 --> 00:03:23.781
We learned the decision rule to
test the null hypothesis that

51
00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:27.300
several auto-correlation
coefficient are zero.

52
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.160
We also learned to test
the null hypothesis

53
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.710
that several auto-correlation
coefficients are zero using R.

54
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.340
In the next lecture we'll actually
look at the real life time series.

55
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.690
And we're going to use all of the tools
that we have acquired until now.

56
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.815
We have a lot of them now.

57
00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:51.240
And we're going to try to fit our real
life model into the real-life data set.
